According to the Youths Digest editor, Gidado Shuaib, in a statement on Wednesday, said the session is aimed at engaging campus journalists on the occasion of this year’s May Day celebrations. Mr Shuaib disclosed that Otufodunrin, a former online editor of The Nation newspaper and now the Executive Director of Media Career Services, will speak on ‘Tips for Building a Successful Career in Journalism’. He added that Amzat, editor of the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), will engage Journalists on ‘Investigating the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Guide for Inspiring Young Journalists’. “Campus journalists, who will be participating in the 3pm event on Friday, can send in their questions and also tweet @lotufodunrin @TheICIR and @YouthsDigest. “Questions and comments can also be forwarded via #CJDChat hashtag,” a statement from the Youths Digest read in part.
