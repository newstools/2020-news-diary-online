 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has described the Supreme Court verdict annulling the conviction of Orji Kalu as a “a technical ambush against the trial of the former governor”. Dele Oyewale, head,  media & publicity of EFCC  who disclosed the commission’s view in a preliminary reaction to the verdict said the anti-graft agency was prepared for a fresh and immediate trial of the former Governor of Abia State. The EFCC reaction reads: “The attention of the Economic And Financial Crimes Commission,  EFCC,  has been drawn to the judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying the trial of a former governor of Abia State,  Orji Kalu ,  his firm,  Slok Nigeria Limited and Jones Udeogu, a former Director of Finance and Account of Abia State Government and ordering their fresh trial at the lower court. “The apex court based its verdict  on the grounds that Justice Mohammed Idris, who convicted Kalu and others had been elevated to the Court of Appeal before the judgment and returned to the lower court to deliver the judgment which it considered as illegal. “The EFCC considers the judgment  of the apex court as quite unfortunate . It is a technical ambush against the trial of the former governor.  The Commission is prepared for a fresh and immediate  trial of the case because its evidences against Kalu and others are overwhelming. The corruption  charges against Kalu still subsist because the  Supreme Court did not acquit him of them.  The entire prosecutorial machinery of the EFCC would be launched in a fresh trial where justice is bound to be served in due course. ..”
