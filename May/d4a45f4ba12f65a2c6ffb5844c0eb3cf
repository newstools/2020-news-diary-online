NAN, however, gathered from community sources that the kidnappers were suspected invaders. A source in Boji-Boji Owa, who gave his name as Benjamin Okwudi, told NAN on Saturday that cases of incessant abductions had been rampant on the Benin-Asaba expressway. “Over the last three years, we have been at the mercy of kidnappers. These criminals parading as herdsmen have been terrorising our community. “This latest incident is just one of the many cases of kidnapping we have been experiencing on the expressway. “This yesterday, we gathered that the suspects ambushed their victims who went to inspect a parcel of land along the expressway. “The kidnappers reportedly shot sporadically and forced their captives into the bush at gunpoint,” Okwudi said.
