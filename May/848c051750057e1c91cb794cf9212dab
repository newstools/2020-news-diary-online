Even when we travelled on holiday to Mecca, Dubai and London, my husband still (went) out for visit and sight-seeing. But under the Lockdown we enjoy watching kannywood and nollywood movies together..”On her part, Hakama Yusuf said, “I wish the government can provide annually Lockdown at least for one month so that we can have enough time with our husband. I never knew how much my husband really cared (as) we go to the kitchen while the housemaid only (does) the laundry and washing.”Also speaking, Zainab Kabiru stated that, “My heart always beats whenever there is this feeling for relaxing the Lockdown. While we enjoyed the Lockdown before the partial lockdown in Abuja, I envy my Married sisters in Kaduna whose husband are completely (in)Lockdown for about two months and I learnt their Governor may extend it by another two months. What a better enjoyment.”For Madinah Mohammed, “The Lockdown during the Ramadan will forever remain fresh in our husband…. My darling not only switched off is general phones, he only communicates with family members on his private numbers. We pray together, recite the holy Quran together, play computer game together and watch movies together… I never believed  a period like this could happen in our life. While we pray for Coronavirus to go, I pray there should be something good that can influence government to announce annually Lockdown if only for a week, twice in a year.”While the coronavirus may have affected trade, jobs and other human endeavor, for some Arewa women, love is indeed in the air..By PRNigeria
