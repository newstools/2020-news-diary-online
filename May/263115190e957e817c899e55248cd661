He said that the decision would affect those civil servants that were not mobile as they would have to enter public transportion to their work places and back.”At the place of work, social distancing can be maintained but what about places such as Lagos and Abuja where the population density is high.” Everybody needs to be conscious of the pandemic as life is precious to be wasted,” Agu said.He noted that one of the biggest weapons of coronavirus is psychological effect and “we do not need to succumb to it because it kills.’’Agu advised workers to tread with caution while going to work on May 4, by observing all the precautionary measures.
