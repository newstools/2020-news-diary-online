 The Emir of Kaura-Namoda in Zamfara, Alhaji Ahmad Asha, on Sunday, died due to the new coronavirus complications, the News Agency of Nigeria has reported. The Zamfara State Government confirmed the death in a statement, saying that the Emir died, aged 71 years. Mustapha Jafaru, the Publicity Secretary of the state’s Committee on Prevention and Control of COVID-19, issued the statement in Gusau. Jafaru said the traditional ruler had been in isolation at the Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau, where he died. He said that having been suspected of COVID-19, respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, the Emir’s blood sample was taken to Abuja for status confirmation. The traditional ruler has since been buried in Kaura-Namoda by officials of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
