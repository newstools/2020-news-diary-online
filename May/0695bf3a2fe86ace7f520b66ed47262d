Reacting to a trending video, Enenche says, “due to mental snap/distress occasioned by fog of war, two of the soldiers who escaped the IED and terrorists’ ambush recorded the incident with uncomplimentary remarks, about the Nigerian Army and her leadership, which was released on the social media. “Although this kind of outburst is expected in war, the soldiers involved have been identified and would undergo observation and counselling”, it reads He added that the Armed Forces of Nigeria will remain unwavering in its quest to end the terrorism and will do everything possible to ensure there is no repeat of this kind of traumatic incident/outburst.
