The Southern Kaduna People’s Union (SOKAPU) on Monday donated food items to two communities in that part of the state recently attacked by suspected bandits. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the two communities are Zangang and Ungwan Makama in Kaura and Kauru Local Government Areas of the state. The National President of SOKAPU, Mr Jonathan Asake, led other officials of the union to present the relief materials to the affected communities. The items included bags of maize flour, rice, beans, and cartons of indomie noodles. Asake said that the union decided to reach out to the people in their time of  need following the destruction of lives and property in their communities. According to him, SOKAPU has made similar donations to affected communities in Chikun and Kauru LGAs as well as in Kaduna town. He expressed appreciation to those who have made contributions to the coffers of the union, which enabled it to reach out to people in need. Asake appealed to the state government to come to the aid of the people in the aforementioned areas through the provision of adequate security to enable them to return to their farms. The Chief of Takad in Kaura LGA, Mr Tobias Wada, and the Village Head of Kizakoro in Kauru LGA, Rev. Dauda Rogo, who received the items on behalf of the communities, praised the union for the gesture. They appealed to public-spirited individuals to emulate the union by reaching out to the affected communities. (NAN)
