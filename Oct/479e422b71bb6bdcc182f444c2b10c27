Rev Yakubu Pam, the Executive Secretary, Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), has advised Nigerian Youths to embrace peace and dialogue, saying “it’s time to cease fire.”
Pam, who made the call at a press conference in Abuja on Monday, said that all hands must be on deck to find a lasting solution to the problems facing the nation.
He said that the current situation in the country has made it compelling for people to work collectively towards building a better Nigeria, adding “the youths have what it takes to be part of the journey to a greater Nigeria.’’ The NCPC boss pleaded with the Nigerian youths to exercise patience and trust President Muhammadu Buhari to fulfill his promise to address their five point demands. Pam said that the wanton destruction of national assets and monuments by those who circumvented the peaceful protest left much to be desired.         According to him, the money which would have been used for infrastructural development would now be used to fix things destroyed by irate youths. ”As an apostle of peace, which I have spent a large chunk of my life pursuing and building bridges, I make bold to say that without peace there cannot be any meaningful development.         ”I wish to express my heart felt commiseration on the death of innocent Nigerian youths who died in the struggle for better tomorrow. ”I therefore wish to call on the organised Nigerian youths to embrace peace and dialogue as the only panacea for enduring resolution to their demands. The time to cease fire is now,” he said. ”We are not against lawful protest which is allowed in any modern democratic setting such as ours,” Pam said. (NAN)
