He commended the i-FAIR to be in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s policy initiative to   take 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.             Meanwhile, Dr Geoffrey Okatubo, Director of Research and Knowledge in the ministry, said that the i-FAIR initiative would boost agriculture and food security in Nigeria. “The i-FAIR is something that is very necessary for us, I can see agriculture and food security is mentioned, and Nigeria is working towards agricultural self-sufficiency.           “So, it will push out our people towards self-sufficiency, secondly the Medical Devices/ Simulation is something that we are going to be very keen about. “We are going to disseminate this information to people we are concerned about and I assure that several people are going to apply through this website,” Okatubo said.            He, however, stressed the need for collaboration between Israel and Nigeria researchers to boost the nation’s innovative capacity.
