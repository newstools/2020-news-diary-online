The Coalition of Northern Groups,CNG has kicked against alleged move to deploy the military against the #EndSARS protesters. A statement by Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, CNG Spokesperson  on Sunday described the move as ill-timed. The CNG spokesman said “The move to deploy the military on Nigerians already taken over by peaceful #EndSARS and #EndInsecuriyNow protesters is ill-timed, ill-advised and a deliberate and costly attempt to provoke the setting in of chaos and further instability. “If government wants to hear the truth, it should be told that the Army boys would do better unleashing their crocodiles on the forests of Sambisa, Birnin Gwari and other spots spread all over northern Nigeria. “It’s quite unthoughtful for the crocodiles or whatever reptiles to be used against peaceful everyday Nigerians who are merely exercising their their civic rights whereas bandits, kidnappers, rapists and insurgents roam about making life difficult for several communities particularly in the North. “Any attempt to further complicate the present situation by militàrizing the tiny civil space, would only make the already darkened clouds hanging over the country darker. “We are quite sure the international community would by now be alert as to where responsibility would ultimately lie in the event of the deterioration of the situation. “The truth is that Nigerians are  angry, frustrated and are unlikely to condone further impunity from leaders who have clearly become a liability.”
