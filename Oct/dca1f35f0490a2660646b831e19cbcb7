The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Plateau chapter, has commended Gov. Simon Lalong for launching a Social Health Insurance Scheme in the state. The Chairman of the association, Dr Innocent Emmanuel, made the commendation in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Jos.       Emmanuel said the gesture was critical toward achieving universal health coverage in the state. NAN reports that Lalong had in 2019 established the Plateau State Contributory Health Care Management Agency (PLASCHEMA) to reduce the financial burden of accessing quality health care in the state through the Health Insurance Scheme.       The NMA chairman expressed optimism that the scheme when fully implemented would also boost productivity among the people of the state. He, then, observed that the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the state was as a result of the sincerity of the State Government in the testing and reporting processes.(NAN)
