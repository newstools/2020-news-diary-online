Contrary to a report published in the online edition of one of the national dailies on Friday October 30th, the Federal Capital Territory Administration has not shut down the Idu COVID-19 treatment and Isolation centre. Acting Secretary of the FCTA Health and Human Services Secretariat, Dr. Mohammed Kawu disclosed this while providing more clarification on the information contained in the said publication. He said while it is true that the FCTA has closed down some isolation centres following a reduction in the number of hospitalised patients recently, Idu centre is still functional and receiving patients. “We only closed down two isolation centres, the Asokoro and Karu general hospitals which were earlier converted to isolation centres but have now been returned to their original use”. “But the Idu Isolation centre which is a 500-bed facility is still opened and managing COVID 19 patients.” He said the FCT Administration has no intention to close down the Idu centre for now until all necessary parameters have been put in place, adding that COVID 19 is still prevalent and we cannot take chances. Dr. Kawu who noted that there has been a significant drop in the number of people coming down with the disease in the FCT, however, appealed to residents to continue with the observation of the non-pharmacological preventive measures of washing of hands with soap and water or hand sanitizers, wearing of face mask , physical/social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.
