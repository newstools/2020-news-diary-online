Second-placed Sassuolo struck twice in the final six minutes to earn a 3-3 draw at home to winless Torino in a lively Serie A encounter in heavy fog on Friday. Torino took the lead in the 33rd minute when Sassuoloâ€™s Romanian defender Vlad Chiriches failed to clear a Mergim Vojvoda cross and Karol Linetty slotted home from close range. The home side drew level in the 71st minute through Filip Djuricic after good work from substitute Mert Muldur.         But Torino responded superbly with two swift goals. Andrea Belotti restored their lead in the 77th minute before a fine finish from Sasa Lukic looked to have made sure of the points two minutes later. But Sassuolo, who would have gone above AC Milan into first place with a win, replied with two quick goals of their own to ensure a share of the points. A superb long distance strike from Chiriches reduced the deficit in the 84th minute before a header from Francesco Caputo made it 3-3.         The draw left Sassuolo on 11 points from five games, a point behind Milan who have a game in hand. Torino are second from bottom after picking up their first point of the season. (Reuters/NAN)
