The Movement for Progressive Youths of Nigeria (MOPYON) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the major achievements recorded so far by his administration in the area of infrastructure development. The group said on Friday that the decision to commend Buhari was reached at their National Caucus Meeting held recently. National Leader of the Movement, Mr Remigius Nwaonu, told newsmen that in the five years of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure had witnessed laudable feats which ranged from anti-corruption fight to infrastructure development as well as youth empowerment. According to him, the administration has been able to counter insurgency, limiting the insurgents to the North East, a feat which he said has restored relative peace to other parts of Nigeria.         “After our National Caucus meeting, it is our pleasure to commend President Muhammadu Buhari and also the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Chibuike Amaechi. We wish to commend Mr President on the giant strides his administration has recorded on security. “One can recall with nostalgia that the Boko Haram Sect has been degraded especially in the North East where they have their operational base. “Recall that they were already making moves to the North Central until President Muhammadu Buhari took over the mantle of leadership and they were chased back into the Sambisa where they are being dealt with by the military. “In the area of Agriculture, you will agree with me that the nation has witnessed a dimension of increase in Agricultural yield, not just for peasants but also for exportation. In the last two years, we have seen a decrease in importation of commodities which can be and are produced in Nigeria.          “The ban on importation of some products by this administration widened yield by the nation’s agricultural sector,” he said. Nwaonu noted that there were also a myriad of social investments programmes which the president introduced, pointing out that the recently introduced Nigerian Youth investment fund was top on the list. “This programme is not only geared towards ending poverty but creating trans-generational wealth where a poor man can become rich because the right environment has been created by the Federal Government,” he said. He said that the government has also recorded successes in road infrastructure, noting that the Second Niger Bridge which is already nearing completion, was a commendable project of the President. On the fight against corruption, he noted that it was a landmark achievement of the administration, stressing that government no longer borrowed to pay salaries but for infrastructure alone.         “Under this administration, borrowings have not been for consumption but for infrastructural development. We are not regretting supporting President Buhari,” he said. In the area of transport, he said that the Federal Government has made an unusual inroad in diversifying the transportation sector. He said that the rail development initiative driven by the Federal Ministry of Transport, led by Amaechi calls for an applause. The group added that the Train plant in Ogun state being built by the Ministry of Transport also deserved applause.         “I have also visited the completed Lagos-Ibadan rail line as well as the Abuja Kaduna rail line. I have seen the Kaduna-Kano and other rail lines. This is very commendable,” he said. On the Nigeria-Niger rail line, he called on Nigerians not to condemn the President but to see the economic benefit of the rail line to Nigeria. “Niger Republic does not have a seaport, at the completion of the rail line, all import transactions of Niger Republic will pass through the Nigerian Seaport,” he said.
