To strengthen election management process and enhance transparency of the system, the portal which could be accessed by longing in to https://inecelectionresults.com, is to enable Nigerians view results from polling units in real time on election day. The portal was introduced alongside the Z-pad, a tablet with dual functions of uploading of scanned copies of election results at polling Units to the portal, as well as a secondary authentication mechanism to support the smartcard readers on voters’ verification on election day.                 The instruments went for test running at the Aug. 8 Nasarawa Central State Constituency by-election in Nasarawa State and subsequently deployed for the Sept. 19 Edo governorship election. (NAN)
