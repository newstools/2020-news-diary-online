A Non Governmental Organisation (NGO), Initiative for Leadership Development and Change (ILDC) has congratulated Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo state and the people of the state over the peaceful conduct of Saturday’s governorship election. Chief Ugochukwu Nnam, ILDC President said this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Abuja on Monday. He said that the Ondo people had reaffirmed their belief in the incumbent governor through the ballot. Nnam, however, commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for ensuring that the election was free, fair and credible. He urged the governor to close ranks with his opponents for a greater and prosperous Ondo state irrespective of their differences.         Nnam expressed confidence in Nigeria’s electoral system which he said was fast improving with the recent election in Edo and Ondo state. “No democracy or election is perfect all over the world but what is important is recognising the veto of the people to make change permissible through the ballot box,” he said. Nnam urged the governor to strive hard and implement peoples’ oriented projects that would help alleviate poverty in the state. Akeredolu polled 292,914 votes to defeat Mr Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who scored 195,431 votes at the election. (NAN)
