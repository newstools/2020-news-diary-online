Tackling graduate unemployment in Nigeria will require  urgent re-engineering of the roles of universities, the Acting Vice-Chancellor of Covenant University, Ota, Ogun, Prof. Akan Williams, has said.  Williams, who was recently appointed by the institution’s  Board of Regents,  told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that universities must empower students and drive societal development.  According to him, some  universities in Nigeria have yet to tailor their activities  toward adequate empowerment of their students.  “What is happening to our universities of technology? Are we really empowering  students there?         ”We have universities of agriculture. What are they producing? We  now have accounting students, mechanical engineering students and a host of others in such universities, which should really not be.  ”These universities are supposed to be specialised institutions of higher learning, where the focus should be technology or agriculture and things around them,” he said.  The acting vice-chancellor said that empowering students  with various skills would require establishment of more specialised universities that would focus  on specific programmes.  ”Lack of focus is largely part of the reasons things are not going the way they should in this country.  “Doing everything at the same time cannot work that way,” he said.  The vice chancellor said that Covenant University had a different philosophy.  ” Our own is  a departure philosophy. It is not about the normal teaching, no hands-on, no experience, no practicality, no application, not even application to life’s situation.           ”As a departure, we want to see how we will continue to empower our students, especially with our Entrepreneurial Development Studies programme that cuts across all levels of study. It is compulsory.  ”In this university, we are going to be identifying skills for particular programmes, such as accounting and economics, and find out the skill sets expected of graduates  of these programmes.  ”The purpose is for students to be able to get these skill sets so that by the time they get out of here, they are  empowered with various skills. It is not about just having certificates.  “It is  for us to drive the system,” he told NAN.
