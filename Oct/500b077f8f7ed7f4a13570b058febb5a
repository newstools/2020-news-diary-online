Residents of Danhonu II, a community in New Millennium City, Chikun LGA of Kaduna State, have appealed to the Federal and State government to switch-on their community electricity which has been connected. Mr Akoh Salifu, Chairman of Danhonu II Landlord Association, who spoke to newsmen on Monday, noted that the Gbagyi community has been in darkness since inception over 100 years ago despite its closeness to Kaduna City.               He said that the community electrification project started in December 2016 with the installation of concrete poles, was scheduled to be completed by January 14, 2017. Salifu however said that the project had dragged on for over three years, and was eventually completed in June 2020 following the intervention of two federal agencies.              “The contractors came to start work in December 2016 promising to finish the project within two weeks. “We were told it was a constituency project by Senator Shehu Sani under Rural Electrification Agency (REA).           “They installed high tension poles from Sabon Jero where they intended to connect the electricity to Danhonu II and some low tension poles to distribute within the community. “They even picked a spot where the transformer would be installed but left without rolling on the wire or installing the transformer.                 “Then another contractor, Niger Delta Power Holdings came to build a power substation in Millennium City and decided to connect Danhonu II to the substation after installing another transformer. “Later the initial contractors came back to install their transformer, rolled on the wire and completed their work, but after four months, they are yet to switch on the light”, he lamented.                Another leader of the community and a veteran journalist, Alhaji Tijjani Tajudeen, said their appeal is for the Federal and Kaduna state governments to switch on the light to take the community out of darkness. “Many members of the community including children have never lived with electricity, contractors came to erect poles, laid wire and installed transformers but for over four months, we have been waiting for the light to be switched on.             “We appeal to governments to come to our aid and light up our community. “All the surrounding communities are enjoying electricity; Danbushiya, Sabon Gida, Keke, Kadaure, Sabon Jero, Doka Maijama, Danhonu I, even Ungwa Ma’aji who were connected in 2019, while we wallow in darkness”, he said.(NAN)
