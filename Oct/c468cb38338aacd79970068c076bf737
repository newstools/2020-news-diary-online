He promised to bring his core competencies in organisational restructuring, quality assurance and project management to bear in driving further the relevance of SON in national socio-economic development.         Salim stressed his desire to strengthen enforcement through increased cooperation with the relevant law enforcement authorities  and the Judiciary. He promised to work more closely with the National Assembly and the Executive arm of Government to update regulations and penalties as well as lobby for improved budgetary allocations for needed improvements and staff welfare.          “We would also leverage on information and communication technology to disseminate our activities more efficiently, real time, in order to engender greater stakeholders’ buy-in and revamp public confidence in our organisation,” he said. The SON helmsman promised to also lessen red tape, further simplify payment systems through increased investment in information technology, to guarantee improved service delivery.           He also promised to imbibe operational efficiency and encourage customer feedback and suggestions toward achieving the goals.
