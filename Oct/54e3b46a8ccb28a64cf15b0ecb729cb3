Ms Beatrice Eluaka, the Executive Secretary, Civil Society Scaling Up Nutrition in Nigeria (CS-SUNN) urged government at all levels to ensure  delivery of affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all.

She called for the approval and implementation of  the National Multisectoral Plan of Action for Nutrition to guarantee optimal nutritional status for Nigerians through accelerating the scaling up of priority high impact nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions. Eluaka called for improvement in the  budgetary allocations of nutritions, releasing and cash backing those allocations while ensuring transparency and accountability in use of funds directed at addressing malnutrition.                 She called for extension of the current four months maternity leave for nursing mothers to 6 months to enable them exclusively to breastfeed their babies among others. She encouraged  Nigerians to increase their overall demand for nutritious food by choosing healthy, and not allowing sustainable habits fall by the wayside.              Sen.
