Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has commended the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, for the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police Force. The governor in a statement personally signed by him, and made available to newsmen on Monday in Asaba, said the disbandment was a decisive response to the legitimate concerns of Nigerians. Okowa described the disbandment of the squad as a “welcome development’’, and commended the Police for not suppressing the protests. “The Nigerian youth can take pride in the fact that they have won a major victory for the right to free movement and association without let or hindrance,” he said.         Okowa added that the disbandment was a visible demonstration of how government agencies should respond to the grievances of the people and agitations for justice and good governance in a democracy. “Finally, let me say that the IGP should not stop at disbanding SARS. That is but one step in the multiple steps required in carrying out a comprehensive reform of the Nigeria Police Force. “Such a reform should cover matters relating to recruitment, training and welfare of the rank and file,” Okowa said.(NAN).
