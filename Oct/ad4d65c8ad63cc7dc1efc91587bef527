Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Monday threatened to impose a second lockdown, if the current spike in coronavirus cases continues. “The situation in hospitals will determine whether a new lockdown is imposed. “No country in the world would allow its intensive medical care to become overwhelmed,’’ Kurz said.          In Austria, the possible overloading of the health system is a legal requirement for imposing a lockdown. On Sunday, Austria introduced a limit of six people for private gatherings indoors and 12 people outdoors. Austria has seen record daily infection numbers in recent days.(dpa/NAN)
