The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has predicted a spike in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak in the country in the next two weeks. Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, made this known on Monday in Abuja at the joint national briefing of the task force.       Mustapha said the prediction was due to the total disregard for the preventive measures against the virus exhibited by thousands of Nigerians protesting in the ongoing #Endsars campaign across various cities in the country. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that thousands of Nigerians have in the past 10 days, taken to strategic areas  across Abuja, Lagos, Edo, Anambra, Rivers and other states to protest against reported police brutality, harassment and extra-judicial killings.       Such brutality is said to be perpetrated by the operatives of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The SGF  said : “Truth be told, two weeks from today, if you get all the people that congregated at the Lekki toll plaza and run a test, you would establish for sure several infections.       “Any mass gathering that does not adhere to the non pharmaceutical interventions that have been put in place, which include wearing of masks, social distancing, keeping personal hygiene and avoiding mass gatherings, they become super spreader events, whether you like it or not. “So I can say with a definitive voice that two weeks from today, get everybody that congregated in those places, not only at the Lekki toll plaza, but also the Unity Fountain in Abuja but several other places, we would definitely be contending with an increase in infections, two weeks from now, and that’s why we must be extremely careful when we congregate.” (NAN)
