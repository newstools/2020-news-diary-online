According to Dauda, fish farming is a very good business which can be started with a little amount of money.      “You can to start up the business with N10,000 or N20,000  and get more profit when you concentrate well. “It is very easy to do the business in an area with enough source of clean water either from the well, stream or boreholes because fishes can only survive in these waters,’’ he said. According to him, fishes can also be reared in a bucket, trampoline, or even by  digging ground for them. “The size of the ground should not be more than five feet long. “The quality of water determines the quality of the fish growth.’’ He advised women to engage themselves in the business because it is not time consuming and not capital Intensive.
