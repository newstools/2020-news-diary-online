Senate on Tuesday at plenary confirmed President Muhammadu buhari’s nominations for appointments as Chairman,Director-General and Commissioners of National Pension Commission(PenCom). The confirmation was sequel to the presentation and consideration of the report of Senate Committee on Establishment and Public Service Matters at the Senate Committee of the Whole. The report was presented by the Vice-Chairman of the Committee,Sen. Mpigi Barinada (PDP Rivers). Presenting the report, Barinaga said the committee screened and found the nominees worthy of the appointments. He,however, said the committee recommended that the nominee from Katsina should be stood down because she was yet to present her National Youth Service Corps certificate (N. Y.S.C) to the committee.            Sen.Enyinnaya Abaribe, (PDP Abia), before the confirmation of the nominees made a case for the re-visiting of the screening of the nominees. He noted that the nominee for the position of Director- General of PenCom should have been picked from the South -East region, following the non completion of the tenure of the former director-general who was from the region. Senators from North East like Ali Ndume(APC Boronu)and Aishatu Dahiru (APC Adamawa), however, argued that it was within the prerogative of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to appoint people in to positions based on existing laws. Following an affirmative voice vote, Senate confirmed the following PenCom nominees are Dr  Oyindasola  Oni, Chairman (Kwara, North-Central), Aisha Dahir-Umar,Director-General (Adamawa, North- East) ,Clement Oyedele Akintola as Commissioner (Ondo South -West), Ayim C.
