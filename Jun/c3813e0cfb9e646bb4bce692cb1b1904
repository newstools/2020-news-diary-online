Nigeria cannot afford to be on-lookers to the changing dynamic and paradigm shift. We must build the capacity of our institutions and human capital to be the front runners in the knowledge economy and knowledge society. The COVID-19 has introduced new vocabularies into the commercial, social and diplomatic transactions. Our people must have the knowledge to be key players in this continental arena. SUSTAINABLE KNOWLEDGE AND RISK ISSUES POST COVID -19 AND BEYOND Risk is as inescapable as it is ubiquitous. We must understand the risk and the challenges and how to turn its careful management to our advantage. Managing risk is not just about avoiding trouble but it can also bring significant rewards. We must develop a risk culture by formalizing the risk management process, learning from success and failure and understanding that risk management is closely linked to innovation and vital for the long-term survival of the organization. We must appreciate various risks we have to face: Strategic – concern with the wider aspects of the business activities – Management, labour, market, scenario, competition, product, consumer, operational Financial – Foreign exchange; * Exchange control    * Programme and Project      * Talent       * Political       * Environmental      * Regulatory      * Sovereign       * Social            * Brand               * Reputational            * Health          * Technological       * Food Security Environmental risk is fast becoming a major concern to all. The impact of human activity on the world climate as well as local ecosystem is increasingly worrying and organizations can no longer ignore this. The COVID-19 and the rapid changes in the world show that the future work and the work of the future, with the various risks, belong to those who can maximize and adapt to knowledge, technology and innovation.

Our goal is to propel Nigeria into a knowledge society and knowledge centre of Africa. Our mission is empowering and enhancing sustainable livelihood of people and we believe that Africa’s vast knowledge demands and utilization are critical to the continent’s long-term infrastructure, economic empowerment and sustainable development. Our Diasporas constitute a huge knowledge capital and we must court them. We partner with various experts and with combined experience, we provide unique opportunity to bridge knowledge gap and expand operations. The COVID-19 expects us to collaborate share knowledge, use our network globally and locally to add value to the benefit of humanity. It is an urgent call to us to use knowledge as an instrument of social, economic and environmental change. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE CAPITAL Development requires knowledge skills, expertise and experience of people. There is dearth of adequately skilled professionals in the management of knowledge society. The knowledge specialists are professionals who know the nature of knowledge demand in a rapidly changing environment. Knowledge and skills gaps are identified to be a major instrument to counter unemployment and social dislocation. The combined unemployment and undevelopment rate of 43:3 (National Bureau of Statistics in Nigeria calls for action. The rate has increased since COVID-19 and it will be worse. However Nigeria could become a major economic centre with knowledge capital as one of the major tools of development The Knowledge Management and Research Institute (KMRI) an off shoot of Knowledge Hub Nigeria with affiliation and partnership with knowledge Management Academy of Vienna, Austria. It is setup to address the skills shortage in the workforce in a knowledge, technology and digital age. It will work with a wide range of experts and stake holders in a knowledge partnership and build global linkages with other knowledge cities around the world. Today the need for globally mobile workforce has never been greater because of the new order and the KMRI provides a platform for bridging the gap in knowledge, technology and digital age. The future is bright but we must all invest in the Knowledge capital to ensure we achieve it. 1ST AFRICAN KNOWLEDGE FOR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP CONFERENCE AND NAIROBI KNOWLEDGE WEEK The first African Knowledge for Development Partnership conference held in Nairobi, Kenya in September 2019 brought together from all parts of the world knowledge specialists, international organizations and practitioners, knowledge societies, United Nations, African Union and other development partners committed to advancing knowledge management and knowledge societies in Africa.
