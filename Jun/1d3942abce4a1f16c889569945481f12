Akosile added that “Apart from the outreach, Mr. Governor is scheduled to spend the better part of the day to attend to many important State matters. “The Governor thanks his numerous supporters and well wishers, who may have planned to celebrate with him in one way or another as he turns 55, advising them to use same resources to touch the lives of the most vulnerable people in their spheres of influence. He said: “the best birthday gift anyone would give me at this period is to identify those at the bottom of the pyramid wherever they reside, lift them up by putting smiles on their faces-that way, you would have lifted my heart too.” Finally, there is no plan for any form of celebration other than what has been stated above,” the statement said.
