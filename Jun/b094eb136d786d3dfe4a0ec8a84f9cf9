 Kaduna state government has expressed deep appreciation to First Lady Aisha Buhari, for donating food items as palliatives to low income earners and vulnerable people in the state. A statement issued by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr Muyiwa Adekeye on Thursday, stated that the First Lady donated food stuff worth millions of naira under her Future Assured Palliatives Support for the less privileged. The Special Adviser noted that Kaduna state government commends the First Lady for identifying with the people in times of need, especially by giving succour to residents who are in dire need. The statement reiterated that Hajiya Aisha Buhuari’s kind gesture is part of the efforts of public spirited individuals, who have been contributing to the COVID-19 Fund to cushion the effects of the pandemic on people in the lowest stratum of society.
