 Edo State  Governor Godwin Obaseki has finally defected to the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. The embattled governor made the move Friday during a visit to the State Secretariat of PDP, reports said. A video of the governor announcing his defection was shared  on PDP’s twitter handle.Watch video: Breaking News! The governor of Edo State, H.

It is however an open secret that Obaseki’s  APC travails were   a fallout  of  the  clash between him and  his immediate past predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole who was national chairman of APC until recently. Obaseki’s defection after losing out  of APC intrigues  is evidently  another twist in the tale of   the  week of high-drama. Earlier, in the week, Oshiomhole’s fortune within the APC also took a nosedive as the  Court of Appeal upheld his suspension from office as National Chairman of APC. How the next chapter of the  Edo drama will  play out  remains to be seen.
