We have so far collected 731 samples, while 655 contacts have completed the 14 days of follow up. “The committee received 839 alerts from across the state and all of them were investigated. “All the patients were from eight local government areas of the state and men constituted 85 per cent of the patient population,” Inname stated. According to the Taskforce chairman, although there was no patient in the isolation centre, the committee would continue with its activities because “many test results were still pending and testing of suspected patients would continue. Also, those tested positive would be isolated.” He advised the people of the state to abide by the safety guidelines of wearing face masks, physical distancing, hands washing and use of sanitiser.
