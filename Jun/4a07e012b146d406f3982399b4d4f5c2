Administration of justice is one of such functions A federation is an embodiment of the governance  inclusive of the Executive,Legislature and Judiciary with a possible expansion to accommodate private, corporate and associated entities. Within that context, it will not be out of place for an Attorney-General of the Federation to administer an oath on any one inclusive of leadership of any political party whether he belongs to it or not. “Within the context of the other consideration, a lawyer, a judge and indeed a private legal practitioner and a commissioner for oath arerecognized statutorily as people vested with the power to administeran oath.
