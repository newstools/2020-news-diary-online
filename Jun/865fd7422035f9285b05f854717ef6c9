The spokesperson said the constable had been subjected to orderly room trial and was found guilty. “The constable has been subjected to orderly room trial where he was found guilty of the offence and has been dismissed immediately from the Force. “This will serve as a deterrent to others of his like in the Force. The suspects were arrested at different locations in the state. “The following exhibits were recovered from them: 10 locally made pistols, 400 live cartridges, 10 expended cartridges, 15 machetes, five axes, wraps of a substance suspected to be cocaine and items suspected to be charms,” he said.
