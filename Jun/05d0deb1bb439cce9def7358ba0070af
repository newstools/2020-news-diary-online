The Minister further tasked the committee members to work with a sense of synergy and purpose towards delivering the national assignments within the timelines set, adding that he and the heads of agency would provide necessary interventions and supports to the committees towards delivering on their terms of reference whenever needed.Present at the inauguration are the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta;  Kasifu Abdullah, Director General, NITDA; and Dr. Abimbola Alale, Managing Director, NIGCOMSAT.
