Out of the 5 affected Staff, 2 survived the shock due to lesser voltages that passed through them, and the immediate application of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) applied on one of them by another staff who ran immediately to the scene upon hearing their loud scream. Unfortunately, three (3) of the victims were lifeless and beyond resuscitation and were later confirmed dead at the state hospital Mortuary, Ijebu- Ode. While other security agencies who were at the scene to rescue the victims immediately commenced investigation into the cause of the incident, the Corps Marshal has also set up a Board of inquiry and ordered immediate investigation with a view to ascertain all variables that led to the unfortunate occurrence.
