Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara loyal to Sen. Kabiru Marafa have denied taking the party to court after the 2019 general elections. New Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the National Secretariat of the APC had set up a disciplinary committee to investigate and sanction any member who violated the directive of its NEC for the withdrawal of all subsisting court cases.   Musa who was the APC factional Chairman of Bagega Ward in Anka LGA, spoke on behalf of the 147 APC ward Chairmen under Sen. Marafa.    The committee has up to Sept. 19, to submit its report. “We are going to make our report available to the general public when we conclude the assignment,” Ja’o said. (NAN)
