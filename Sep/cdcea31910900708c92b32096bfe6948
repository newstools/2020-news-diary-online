They are watching. “It is important that we all remain above board in the performance of our respective duties. “We must ensure that no political party or candidate is accorded any advantage over the other,” Yakubu said. He said that as INEC begins the final countdown to the Edo governorship election, it was clear that all eyes were on the INEC to deliver a free, fair and credible process. Yakubu said he had no doubt that INEC staff  would rise to the occasion, saying, `we have done it several times before and we can do it again. “The Commission deeply appreciates the ever ending sacrifices made by our staff at all times, often beyond the call of duty, to ensure that we carry out our mandate. “The management will continue to improve the welfare and conditions of service of staff within the available resources. “We must be neutral at all times and stick strictly to our code of conduct and oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed. “For at the end of the day, we would have all contributed to the sustenance of democracy and a strong electoral process that all Nigerians can trust,” he said.
