Also speaking, the Chairman of SEMA, Alhaji Sani Dododo, attributed this yearâ€™s flooding in the state to high rainfall, which led to the discharge of water from Goronyo dam in Sokoto state and Bakolori dam in Zamfara. Dododo said that the flood resulted to the death of many people and destruction of farmlands and houses in communities along Rima River. He appealed to the federal government, NGOs and individuals to assist the flood victims. (NAN).
