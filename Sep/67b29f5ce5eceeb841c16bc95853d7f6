The acting commissioner urged the participants not to see themselves as ordinary farmers but as businessmen and women operating in the agric sector. ”We want you to start thinking of startegy to improve your production level, food supply and pricing,” the acting commissioner said.

Everything is in line with what we want to achieve. “I want to assure you that the ministry of agriculture is fully behind you, fully in support of you and we’re working on everything you are asking for around tractorisation, even up to swamp buggy,” Olusanya said. Mrs Oluranti Sagoe-Oviebo, State Project Coordinator, Lagos APPEALS, said that the project had supported five cluster groups in rice production; each cluster consisted of 10 members. She said the APPEALS project was set up to address challenges confronting farmers in the three value chains of rice, poultry and aquaculture.        She said the farmers in Gayingbo were trained in Ibadan on rice farming techniques and the outcome was implemented by the beneficiaries. Sagoe-Oviebo said the project supported the farming cluster groups with rice seeds, fertilisers, mechanised transplanter, harvester, agro-chemicals, motorised sprayer, Ripper, ferteliser applicator, Thresher, plough, as well as finance for mechanised farming and alliance. She said the project had also supported rice off taker with a colour sorter machine, the first of its kind in Lagos to help in sorting the rice. “Our target is to take Lagos rice out of Nigeria and not just within Nigeria. “We have already selected a pure strain of Ofada rice that will give us shining grain and we are going to use the colour sorter to give us premium rice at the end of the day.        ”We will support our farmers from production to processing and marketing. Some farmers are presently undertaking training with NAFDAC and other food organisation on how to obtain certification for premium quality rice. “We will do whatever we can to make life easier for our farmers,” she said. Mr Samuel Obitunde, Head of Gayingbo cluster group, commended the APPEALS project for its numerous support to the farmers. “In the whole of Lagos State, you cannot talk about rice without mentioning Gayingbo as a stakeholder. “We thank the Lagos State government both past and present have really demonstrated their passion for rice cultivation in the state. “APPEALS project has supported us with 600 bags of fertilisers for 100-hectares of land, five tons of viable Ofada rice seeds, 1,000 liters of agro-chemicals, three Threshers and fertiliser applicator and many more.        “We want to assure the government that we will support the Imota rice mill project whenever it commences operations. “We urge the government to provide tractor and swamp buggy machine and roads to open-up more farmlands,” he said. Also, Mr Segun Atho, Deputy National President, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), commended the APPEALS project and the Lagos state government for their support towards the realisation of rice cultivation in the state. Atho said that the project supported the farmers with farrow 44 rice seeds, adding that the farmers would not disappoint the government.
