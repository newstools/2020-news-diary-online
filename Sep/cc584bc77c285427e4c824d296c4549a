The  police on Monday arraigned two persons – Joseph Adole  and Samuel Ikoji  – both aged 24, before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged unlawful possession of a gun and ammunition. The defendants, whose addresses were not stated, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and unlawful possession of firearm and ammunition.        They, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, ASP Kehinde Ajayi, told the court that the defendants conspired to commit the offences  on July 26, at 2.40p.m. at Odonia in Ikorodu, Lagos State.      Ajayi said that the defendants possessed  a pistol  and ammunition without a licence, adding that they could not  give a satisfactory account of them. She said that the offences contravened Sections 330(d) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.       Section 330(d) provides for seven years jail term for unlawful  possession of arms and ammunition. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs A.O. Ajibade, granted each of the defendants bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum.      She directed that  one of their respective  sureties  must be a blood relation. Ajibade adjourned the case until Oct. 15 for substantive  hearing. (NAN)
