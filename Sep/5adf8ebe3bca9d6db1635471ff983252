Alhaji Mohammed Gabdo, Director, National Orientation Agency (NOA), Adamawa State, has urged political office holders to empower youths on sustainable agricultural development to reduce unemployment. Gabdo made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Yola.    He said such empowerment would enable them to be self-reliant and employers of labour. Gabdo said that politicians and members of the private sector must contribute their quotas in youth empowerment, noting that government could not do the work alone.   “Our political office holders should come and empower the unemployed youth in their respective constituencies, especially on sustainable agricultural development,” Gabdo said. Gabdo who commended governments focus on agriculture development said that it sustained the country in the past.    ”So if the youth are empowered with requisite skills, at the end of the day, some of them may be better than those employed in the civil service because farming is a lucrative business,” he said. According to him, this will help to reduce the rate of crime, drug abuse and other evil vices in society.    He noted that in the long run, the beneficiaries might not forget their gesture, especially if they should come back seeking any political support or reelection. Gabdo, however, called on the youth to be good ambassadors by doing the right thing at any given time.    He urged them to take advantage of employment programmes to be self-reliant and contribute their own quota for the development of the state and Nigeria at large. (NAN)
