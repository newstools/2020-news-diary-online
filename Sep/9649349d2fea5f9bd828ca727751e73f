A betting agent, Akehomen Timothy, 27, on Thursday appeared in a Grade I Area Court, Mpape, Abuja, for allegedly stealing N74,200 from his employer. The police charged Timothy, who resides in Mashafa area of Mpape, Abuja with theft.       The Prosecution Counsel, Stanley Nwaforaku, told the court that the complainant, Nurudeen Ismail of Nassarawa State, reported the matter at the Police Station in Mpape, Abuja.
