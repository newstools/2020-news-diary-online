Communique of the Chinese Infrastructure Loan analytical workshop Expert Roundtable – Are Chinese Infrastructure Loans Putting Nigeria on the Debt Trap Express?  The Experts Roundtable – “Are Chinese infrastructure Loans putting Nigeria on the debt-trap express?” arises from the ongoing discussion regarding whether Nigeria or state governments should take Chinese infrastructure loan. The Nigerian press has been awash with concern about the terms of some loans contracted with or about to be contracted with China. Data obtained from the Debt Management Office (DMO) shows that between 2010 and March 31, 2020, 11 loan facilities have been obtained from the China Exim Bank. The loans all have a seven-year grace period, 20 years tenor and were obtained at 2.5 per cent interest rate.

This communique includes presentations and discussions by the distinguished speakers, as well as recommendations and conclusions          Mr. Joseph Oyediran.        Mr. Johnson Chukwu.

The Capital Importation Report shows that Nigeria earned less than $1bn in Q1 2020. Portfolio Investment which could have aided infrastructure build is in decline. With a debt of N26.9bn in the Q1 of 2020 alone, funds being earmarked for debt servicing are and will continue to rob us of infrastructure if we do not seek alternative options for funding options such as:          Prof. Mobolaji Aluko.
