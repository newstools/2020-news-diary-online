Don’t argue with me, don’t waste your data, just go to KANO STATE and see for yourself. “The truth is, as Nigerians we should only consider work on ground. No one should say shit about Ganduje unless you have done equal or more work. Simple. He is not from Edo and kano as a state is above many.   I am from Kano state and Oyo state and no matter what you say or think of Ganduje, he is one of the few elected officers who are actually implementing projects. Don’t argue with me, don’t waste your data, just go to KANO STATE and see for yourself. — Fatima Ganduje-Ajimobi (@FatimaGanduje) September 20, 2020  — Fatima Ganduje-Ajimobi (@FatimaGanduje) September 20, 2020
