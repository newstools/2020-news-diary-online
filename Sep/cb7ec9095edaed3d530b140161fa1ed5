Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa has called on religious leaders to create more awareness against drugs abuse, especially among the youth. Fintiri made the call during the general assembly and presentation of the 1442 Islamic calendar and prayer time by the state’s Muslim Council in Yola on Saturday.    He said that this would help the youth to succeed in life and to reduce the rate of crime such as kidnappings, farmers/headers clashes and the menace of `Shilaboys’. He pledged more youth empowerment programmes and reiterated his readiness to continue investing in the Education sector.    Fintiri also called for more support and understanding for security agencies, to ensure the security of lives and prosperity and also shun the attitude of a willful violation of the law. He commended the clerics for their support and prayers and urged them to continue to support him, in order to be able to deliver on his mission successfully.    Prof. Ibrahim Ahmed, Chief Imam of the National Mosque, Abuja, who was the guest speaker, urged the Muslim faithful to understand the significance of the Islamic calendar and prayer timing. He said: “timing in Islam is very important as each and every prayer has its own time, especially in the month of Ramadan”.    According to him, going by the importance of time, God had sworn severally in the Holy Quran and Prophet Muhammad had also stressed on it. He advised people to utilise their time judiciously for more blessings in life and after death.    In his remarks, Alhaji Gambo Jika, the Council Chairman, thanked all that contributed to the success of the council and prayed for God to reward them with paradise. He said that the project for the construction of an ICT centre was ongoing and plans for the expansion of the council’s clinic had reached an advanced stage.    Jika then called on those who wished to contribute to the success of the council projects to do it for the sake of Allah. (NAN)
