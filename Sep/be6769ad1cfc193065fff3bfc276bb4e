Rep. Kabiru Mai-palace (Gusau/Tsafe Constituency), on Monday in Gusau donated 10 motorcycles to his former school teachers. Mai-palace said the gesture was to appreciate the teachers for their impact on his life. “Teachers deserve respect and honour considering their selfless sacrifice to humanity,’’ he said. The lawmaker remarked that although some people say ‘teachers’ reward is in heaven,’ there was need for their former well-to-do students to assist them. “Specifically, I have to acknowledge the roles you played as my teachers in making my life more resourceful and productive,’’ he said.        Mai-palace said he would not relent in consulting the former teachers on personal and official issues. Malam Salihu Anka, a former Permanent Secretary in the state, who taught the lawmaker, said that such gesture was expected of right thinking students that had made achievements in life. Malam Sanusi Yakubu, the Provost, Zamfara College of Arts and Science (ZACAS) also a beneficiary, commended the lawmaker and advised him not to be deterred. (NAN)
