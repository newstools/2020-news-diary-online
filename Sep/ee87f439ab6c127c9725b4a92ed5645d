A member of the Ogun House of Assembly, Mr Damilola Soneye (APC-Obafemi Owode), on Thursday donated two boreholes to Imedu Olori village, Mowe and Aseese town, Ibafo, both in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the state. The Ogun lawmaker also donated two 3,000kva generators to power the boreholes which were to be maintained by the communities. Speaking to newsmen after the donation, Soneye said that the facilities were self-financed and not a constituency project which were provided in response to the yearnings of the people in the area. He said that the gesture would complement the state government’s efforts at making life more meaningful to the people. Soneye promised that more development projects would be facilitated to his constituency.       “This is the request of the people and I want to assure them of good representation till the last minute of my tenure. ”There are ongoing projects on school buildings, markets and more boreholes to come,” he said. The Community Head, Aseese Town, Jamiu Sonola, commended the lawmaker for the kind gesture, saying that he should continue to be a good representative of the people at the assembly. (NAN)
