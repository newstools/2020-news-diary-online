The Nigerian Army has commended the Nasarawa State Government for the construction of access road through the Kenyehu Uttu Forest and contiguous hills in Toto Local Government Area of the state. This was conveyed in a statement by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col. Sagir Musa, on Wednesday in Abuja.        Musa said that the state government heeded the advice of Nigerian Army conveyed through the Commander 4 Special Forces Command, Doma to construct the access road. He said the opening up into such remote and isolated area with attendant infrastructural development would bring governance and prosperity to such hitherto ungoverned spaces.
