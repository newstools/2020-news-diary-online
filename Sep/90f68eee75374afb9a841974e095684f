A group of youths in Osogbo on Tuesday evening staged a protest over the killing of one of them by operatives of the military Joint Task Force (JTF) in Osun State. Tne News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the youths, armed with sticks and other dangerous weapons, attacked passers-by during the protest.
