The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has advised motorists to be patient and apply controlled-speed on the highways during this Ember-months period. The FRSC Sector Commander in Enugu State, Mr Ogbonnaya Kalu, gave the advice while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Saturday.      NAN reports that the Ember-months included the months of September, October, November and December. According to Kalu, the insinuation that blood sucking demons take over roads during Ember-months period is never true.      “It is human negative attitude that most times lead to increase in crashes and even deaths,’’ he said. “The major causes of possible increase in road crashes in this period remained human impatient and negligence.        “The human deficiencies stem from impatience and anxiety to meet up personal or group target before the year runs out. “With impatience and anxiety to meet up target; most motorists care less about other road users and even their own health and body system during this period. “Another is the negligence of pushing out mechanically deficient vehicles during this time to make more money or returns even at the detriment of passengers and other road users as well,’’ he said.      The sector commander noted that due to the perceived human deficiencies leading to crashes; the command had already embarked on massive road safety education in parks, churches, mosques and public gatherings in the state. According tp him, as the lead agency on road traffic management and safety; we are all out this season to ensure our people are educated and they are very cautious driving in the not friendly weathers such as rain and harmattan seasons during the Ember-months period.       “Our education also covers the need for motorists and transporters to adhere to the guidelines on COVID-19 prevention as far as vehicular movement of humans and goods are concerned,’’ he said. He noted that the command would also carry out road audit; vehicular logistic repairs and maintenance for special end of the year and festive operation and improve on joint patrols with sister security agencies.       He said that the corps was determined to reduce crashes in the state to zero level at the end of the Ember Months this year. (NAN)
