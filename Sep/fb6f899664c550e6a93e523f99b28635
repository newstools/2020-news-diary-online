The Emir of Lafia, Justice Sidi Bage on Monday called on parents  to give priority attention to girl-child education to enable them contribute their quota to nation building. Bage made the call while conferring traditional title of Garkuwan Ilimi Mata Nasarawa on Dr Hauwa Muhammad-Mainoma at his Palace. He said giving premium to girl-child education would go a long way to reducing street hawking among them.      The monarch explained that women have significant roles to play in ensuring proper upbringing of children in a society, adding that lack of knowledge was undermining such efforts. Bage said that the significant role of an educated girl child to the society and the world generally must be fully harnessed. The emir said women as custodian of the home needed to be educated for the growth and development of their families and the society at large.      Bage, who is also the Chairman Nasarawa State Council of Traditional Rulers, advised children to shun sentiments and work towards ensuring peace and unity of the state. He noted that the title conferred on Muhammad-Mainoma was based on her contributions to development of education in the state. The monarch advised other title holders to ensure that there impacts are felt by their communities. In her remarks, the newly turbaned Garkuwan Ilimi Mata Nasarawa, pledged to put in her best in the development of education in the state.      She said that the new honour would spur her to do more for the emirate and Nasarawa State. Muhammad-Mainoma, who is also the wife of the immediate past Vice Chancellor, University of Keffi ‎thanked the Emir for finding her worthy to serve the emirate council. “I will not fail the emir, and I will not fail the entire emirate council. I will discharge my responsibilities in the best way I can to justify the confidence reposed on me, and to ensure it is not abused in any way,” she said. (NAN)
