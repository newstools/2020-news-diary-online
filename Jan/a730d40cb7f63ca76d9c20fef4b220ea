In its bid to crackdown
on individuals and organisations engaged in energy theft and meter bypass
within its franchise states, Kaduna Electric has inaugurated a special
investigation and prosecution taskforce on electricity offences that will
assist in fighting the menace. The Task Force, comprises
officials from the Attorney General and Minister of Justice’s office, men of
the Nigerian Police Force and staff of Kaduna Electric. The inauguration which
took place at the company’s corporate headquarters was conducted by the MD/CEO
Engr Garba Haruna who was represented by Mr Rahul Kumar, the Company’s Chief
Driving Officer. In his welcome remark, Mr
Kumar charged the team to be professional in the discharge of their assignment
and to be sincere in their dealings with electricity users. He said the high
frequency of meter bypass and energy theft is responsible for lost revenue
running into millions of Naira every month and  responsible for the
challenges facing the electricity sector in the country. The Team Lead of the
special Taskforce, Mr Aliyu Bamalli, assured the Management of Kaduna Electric
that he is confident the team will carry out its mandate diligently and with
integrity. “The mandate of the taskforce
has no boundary. They can disconnect any customer no matter how big or small.
The taskforce will disconnect any company that engages in any form of energy
theft and will seek the prosecution of the company in court”, he said. Mr Aliyu warned customers
caught bypassing their meters or engaging in energy theft that they will be
prosecuted alongside the staff of Kaduna Electric or the ‘NEPA 2’ responsible
for bypassing the meter or connecting the premises illegally. The Head, Corporate
communication of Kaduna Electric, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, who issued the
statement after the inauguration appealed to customers not to engage in meter
bypass and energy theft to avoid the embarrassment of prosecution.
