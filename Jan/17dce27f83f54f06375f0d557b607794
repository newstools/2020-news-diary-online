The
Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC),
Ibrahim Mustapha Magu has urged financial institutions in the country to do more
towards ensuring that their customers are protected from the nefarious
activities of cyber criminals. Magu
made this appeal on Saturday, January 11, 2020 while speaking as a guest
speaker at an event organised by Ilorin Bankers Committee, titled: “Cyber
Crimes Threat and Challenges: the role of Financial Institutions. “ The
EFCC boss, who was represented by Head, Advance Fee Fraud Unit, Ilorin Zonal
Office of EFCC,  Mr Olamide Sadiq tasked financial institutions on
awareness creation and education of their customers on the antics of cyber
criminals and to collaborate with law enforcement agencies and their in-house
cyber security units to identify suspicious activities. “As
financial institutions, you must make sure you create awareness and educate
your customers on the dangers of internet fraud and other fraud-related
offences,” Magu stated while  advocating for information sharing on
cyber crime and money laundering among financial institutions. He
noted that there instances where bankers collude with criminals to defraud
their customers, and urged financial institutions to do background checks of
their staff before employing them.
