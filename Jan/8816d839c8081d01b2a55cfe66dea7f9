Operatives of the Department of
State Security(DSS) last  Friday at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa International
Airport in Bauchi state  seized a amount of cash totaling two hundered and
seventy five million naira (N275,000,000.00) en route the federal capital
territory(FCT) Abuja. A source at the airport revealed to our correspondent that the cash was made of
N250million and $70,000.00 was being ferried  to Abuja and allegedly owned by a commercial
bank(name withheld) An eagle-eyed DSS operative was not  convinced by  reasons advanced
by the lone escort of the humungous amount of cash and sought a CBN
authorisation allowing  transit of cash of that volume . The inability to produce
authorisation compelled the DSS operative to call for back up leading to the
confiscation of the cash brought in unmarked sacks. Sources  said the seized funds have been deposited into
the custody of the CBN. However, tongues are already wagging
in Bauchi since the story broke out  at the weekend which has not been
reported by mainstream media. Speculations are however rife that the confiscated cash was on its way to serve unholy interests ahead of a crucial  legal  verdict . So far ,the bank has kept mute and
efforts to get it to comment  has been rebuffed while the Bauchi state
government has remained silent, giving room for endless speculations.
