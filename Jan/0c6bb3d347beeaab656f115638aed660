By Chimezie Godfrey The Debt Management Office of
Nigeria (DMO) has said that the level of new borrowings in appropriation acts declined
consistently  since Nigeria exited the recession in the year 2017. The Director General, Patience Oniha
at a press briefing in Abuja on Friday also reiterated the fact that the
increase in the new borrowings in the appropriations acts between 2015 and 2017
was due to the need to stimulate growth and create jobs in the economy in the
Economic Recovery Growth Plan(ERGP). The DMO at a series of interactive
sessions presented a review of activities and its plans for raising capital
from domestic and external sources in the year 2020. The sessions involved banks and
institutional investors in the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) securities amongst
which were Pension Funds Administrators(PFA), Insurance companies, Fund and
Asset Managers. According to the DG,”The
presentation by the DMO at the interactive sessions showed that the Total
Public Debt, comprising the debts of the FGN, 36 states and the Federal Capital
Territory(FCT) as at September 2019 stood at 26.215trillion naira. “The comparative figure for
June 2019 was 25.701trillion naira which implies that in the quarter July to
September 2019 the Total Public Debt grew by 2.0%. “The DMO also stated that the total
public debt as at September 2019 includes promissory notes in the amount of
821.651billion which had been issued to settle the FGN’s arrears to oil
marketing companies and State Governments under the Promissory Programme
approved by the Federal Executive Council and the National Assembly.” Oniha informed the stakeholders at
the interactive sessions that whereas the 2019 Appropriation Act provided for a
total new borrowing of 1,605.63billion naira split equally between Domestic and
External, only the domestic component of 802.82billion was raised due to the
late passage of the 2020 budget would commence on January 1, 2020. She listed as achievements for 2019,
the issuance of a 30-year FGN Bond for the first time. According to her, the introduction
of a 30-year FGN Bond was  to meet the investment needs of long-term
investors such as insurance companies and support the development of the
domestic financial markets in areas such as mortgages. She added that from the FGN
perspective the 30-year Bond also contributed to reducing the refinancing risks
of the Public Debt Stock. She further said that the product
has enjoyed a strong demand as 284.391 billion and 570 billion had been issued
by the end of September 2019 and December 2019 respectively. “The ratio of Domestic Debt to
External Debt at 69:31 was about the same as at June 2019 of 68:32 compared to
the target of 60:40 in the Medium-Term Debt Strategy. “The ratio of Long Term to
Short Term Debt in the domestic debt was 80:20 which shows that the target of
75:25 had been outperformed. “Similarly,total debt as a
percentage of GDP was 18.47% as at September 2019 which was within the limit of
25% and fares better in comparison with the debt/GDP ratios of countries such
as the United States of America, United Kingdom and Canada with ratios of 105%,
85%, and 90% respectively for the period. “However, because they generate
adequate revenues, their debt service/revenue ratios for the same period were
much lower at 12.5%, 7.5% and 7.5% respectively when compared to Nigeria’s 51%
in 2017,” she said. The DG pointed out that low revenue
base of Nigeria relative to its GDP is clearly reflected in the high debt
service to revenue ratio, adding that this clearly brings to the fore, the need
for revenues to grow. She said that the efforts towards
increasing and diversifying revenue such as the passage of the Finance Act and
Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget
and National Planning should thus be supported. Speaking further, she said the DMO
has also unveiled its plans for the year 2020, based on the New Borrowings in
the 2020 Appropriation Acts, which comprises of 850billion and 744.99billion
for External and Domestic Borrowings respectively. ”The New Domestic Borrowings will
be raised through FGN Bonds, Sukuk, FGN savings Bonds and possibly Green Bonds. “For External Borrowings the
strategy is to first seek out concessionary and semi concessionary loans due to
the lower interest rate and longer tenors. Any short fall thereafter may be
raised from commercial sources,” she said.
