Walking with Shadows, a film co-produced by Funmi Iyanda
and Olumide Makanjuola, has been scheduled for screening at the 2020 Göteborg
Film Festival in Gothenburg, Sweden. Directed by
Irish writer/director, Aoife O’Kelly, the film is an adaptation of Jude Dibia’s
critically acclaimed novel of the same title. It will be
screened in Gothenburg for four consecutive days from Wednesday, January 29 to
Saturday, February 1. Starring Ozzy
Agu, Zainab Balogun, Ayoola, Funlola Aofiyebi-Raimi, Wale Ojo, Adunni Ade and
Funsho Adeolu, Walking with Shadows is the story of a man who turns away a
comfortable life to be true to himself. The film takes
place in Lagos, where Ebele Njoko (Agu) recreates himself as Adrian – a
respected father, man and brother. His whole world soon falls apart when his homosexuality
is revealed. According to
Ms. Iyanda, “The film fully explores many pressing societal issues which
sections of the Nigerian society can relate with, but cannot freely address
while also promoting the importance of self-discovery and acceptance in a
cultural society.” Other
producers on the project are Xeenarh Mohammed and Victoria Thomas. Göteborg Film
Festival is the largest film festival in Scandinavia. The 10-day
festival showcases nearly 450 films from some 80 countries from across the world. Walking with
Shadows was premiered at the BFI London Film Festival in October 2019 and
screened at the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF), Lagos in November. It is an OYA
Media production in partnership with The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERs).
