Deputy Chief Whip of
the Senate, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, has said the emergence of newly sworn-in
Governor of Imo State,  Senator Hope Uzodinma, through a Supreme Court
ruling on Tuesday marks the beginning of an era of ‘hope and prosperity’ for
Imo State. Senator Abdullahi, in
a statement signed in Abuja congratulating Uzodinma and the All Progressives
Congress (APC), called on the newly sworn-in Governor to, as a matter of
urgency, prioritize the security and welfare of citizens of the State. The lawmaker also
charged the Governor to embark on a process of “healing” for all political
actors in the state, noting that doing so will greatly reduce tension and
guarantee speedy development under his watch. “The ruling by the
Supreme Court on the 2019 Governorship election in Imo State on Tuesday signals
hope and prosperity for its people, particularly under the All Progressive
Congress (APC). “However, for success
to be recorded, I urge the newly sworn-in Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, to
as a matter of urgency put in place initiatives and policies that would
guarantee the security and welfare of citizens of the state. “Also, it is necessary
for the Governor to extend a hand of fellowship to all political actors in the
state, so as to bring about healing and reduce existing political tension. “I have no doubt that
as an Ambassador of the National Assembly who understands the workings of
representation, the Governor would make the institution proud by always putting
the interest of Imo citizens ahead of all other considerations,” Sabi Abdullahi
said.
