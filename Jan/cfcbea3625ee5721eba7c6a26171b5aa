The trial of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal was on Thursday stalled in FCT High Court Maitama on account of illegible prosecution witness document. Mr Aminu Ahmed, the fourth prosecution witness had introduced himself as Principal Procurement officer in the office of secretary to the government of federation. Ahmed, while testifying also told the court that he was a member of the evaluation committee that recommended the contract to Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP). Ahmed, however, became stock when asked by Mr Ufom Uket, the prosecuting counsel to read a document which was BPP’s response statement to the recommendations of the evaluation committee. The witness explained that the document was illegible, adding that he could not read it. In the circumstance, Uket prayed the court for an adjournment to enable them bring clearer copy of the report. Justice Jude Okeke, therefore, adjourned the matter until Feb. 19 for continuation of trial since there was no any objections raised. Lawal is standing trial in alleged fraudulent award of N544.1million for grass cutting contract through the Presidential Initiative for North East. The ex-SGF’s brother, David Lawal, a director of Rholavision Engineering Limited is also standing the trial.Others are Sulaiman Abubakar, Managing-Director of Josmon Technologies Limited, and Apeh Monday. NAN recalls that the defendants are charged with 10-count charge bordering on conspiracy and fraud. The EFCC said the alleged offences were contrary to Section 12 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. However, the defendants had pleaded not guilty to the charge leveled against them.
