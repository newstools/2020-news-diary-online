Former Vice
President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar pays tribute to members of Nigeria’s armed
forces for what he calls their invaluable, incalculable and immeasurable
sacrifices in the defence of the country’s territorial integrity. In his goodwill message to mark
the Armed Forces Remembrance Day on January 15, Atiku reminds of the
contributions of these patriotic and amazing military personnel who have put
their own lives on the line for the sake of others. “While we sleep in our
homes, these amazing patriots are in the field fighting to protect us, leaving
the comfort of their own families for our sake. “People who expose
themselves to these daily risks to their own lives in order to protect others
deserve our highest esteem, and I am sure no reward is enough for their
patriotic services”. The scourges of terrorism and
armed banditry have put a greater burden of responsibility on the shoulders of
these men and women in military uniform. Despite these additional
challenges of internal security, members of our armed forces are still carrying
out their duties with vigour, zeal and commitment. The members of our armed forces
should remain united at all times because millions of Nigerians perceive them
as role models of unity and national integrity. The Boko Haram terrorists have
tried to divide members of our armed forces, but they have stood united against
these cold hearted killers. Nigerians should continue to
pray for these great patriots who have sacrificed their own comforts for our
sake because we cannot adequately pay them back for their professional and
patriotic services to the country.
