Police in Vietnam are searching for a senior police officer for allegedly shooting dead four gamblers and seriously injuring another over a quarrel in Ho Chi Minh City, authorities said on Thursday. The incident occurred on Wednesday when 33-year-old police officer Le Quoc Tuan allegedly opened fire at a group of fellow gamblers in the Cu Chi district of Ho Chi Minh City, according to Cu Chi police. Four gamblers died at the scene and one is in a critical condition in the hospital, police said. Local newspaper VnExpress reported Tuan joined the gambling ring, but lost all his money and subsequently had a quarrel with the other gamblers. The suspect left, returned with a gun, and fired at the people in the ring, according to the report. He also killed a dairy cow nearby before allegedly stealing a scooter from one of the gamblers and escaping with the weapon. The case is under investigation.(dpa/NAN)
