The new President of
Association of Licensed Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria (ALPSPN) Mr.
Esangbedo Wilson  has stressed that the
body  will not and never support any move
to remove the mandate of regulation of Private Guard Industry from Nigeria
Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). Esangbedo made the
statement on Friday
January 17th during the Press Conference held at the corporate
headquarters of ALPSPN in Abuja.   He emphasized that ALPSPN
leadership has over time built a mutual working relationship with NSCDC,
therefore, we shall not welcome any move to remove the regulation of the
Private Guard industry from NSCDC.  The Corps has been a great partner to
us over the years, moreover NSCDC work with integrity which is the watchword of
the government of the day under President Muhammadu Buhari, therefore, we shall
not allow our association to be compromised; he stated. ALPSPN and NSCDC are
working hard to re-organize the Private Guard Industry with far reaching
reforms as contained in the Private Guard Regulation of 2018.  We are
currently changing the face of security practice as guards biometrics will be
taken by our regulator.  Our guard will be trained, certified and
licensed, Esangbedo assured. Companies that will
train the guards will be accredited by NSCDC and ALPSPN and the accredited
companies will also have their trainers accredited. The current effort
of our regulators to make the private guard industry to be as par with the
advanced countries is commendable and will be supported by ALPSPN. Wilson assured that,
the new executive of ALPSPN shall visit the Commandant General, Nigeria
Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Abdulahi Gana Muhammadu on familiarization
tour to pledge our support for his landmark reform of Private Guard Companies
since he took over the affairs of the organization.
