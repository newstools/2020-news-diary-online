Justice A.T
Mohammed of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, on Friday,
17 January, 2020 sentenced one Tarila Ebizimor to seven years
imprisonment for obtaining money under false pretence to the tune of
N4.000.000.00 (Four Million Naira). The convict, a
supervisor in the Security Department of the Niger Delta Development
Commission, NDDC was prosecuted by the Port Harcourt Zonal Office of the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on a four-count charge. Ebizimor’s journey
to prison began sometime in August, 2013 when he paraded himself as personal
assistant of the managing director of the NDDC and obtained the sum of
N4million from the petitioner on the pretext that he will help facilitate the
award of road construction contract to him. One of the charges
against him reads: “That you Tarila Ebizimor on the 13th day
of August, 2013 in Port Harcourt, Rivers State within the jurisdiction of this

and thereby committed an offence, contrary to Section 1(i)(a) of Advance Fee
