He promised that all Sharia Courts will be renovated, while all Judges will be provided with official cars. “It is not befitting or even safe to site a Judge riding a commercial motorcycle”, Governor Matawalle observed. The Governor said he had observed that whatever his administration announced to do, was attacked by the opposition, pointing out that projects such as these, were changes some people do not want, but his administration is bent on bringing these changes.

In his vote of thanks, the new Grand Khadi thanked the Governor for the honour done to him and promised to carry out his duties without fear or favour. “I promise to he firm and just in the discharge of my duties. We thank His Excellency for his intention to address the problems faced by the Judiciary”.
