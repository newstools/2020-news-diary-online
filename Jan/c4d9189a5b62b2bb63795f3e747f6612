Saidu The Kupa community, in Kogi State under the auspices of its
development association cries out to the Federal Government to urgently
find a solution to the Ayetoro-Abugi-Eggan
road, as the road would soon give way and might cause loss of lives and
properties as we approach  the next
raining season soon. The government effort was
worthy of praise because of the way it has been working more than talking since
the inception of this Administration, especially in providing social services ,
Agricultural revamping and Sustainable economic drive; but without good roads
the impact will not be felt considerably, most especially at the local level
such as ours. The Ayetoro-Abugi-Eggan road has totally
collapsed, it has never been(fully) constructed and has already claimed several
lives in the years past. Now we call on the Federal Government to please
expedite action on making the road motorable 
 so that the people of this (area)
can benefit  from  the dividends of democracy. Even though over
180 million was budgeted in 2018 National budget and identified as a new
project but the job  has not commenced. The
national body of this organization wants to use this medium to really thank the
FG (which) considered  the road contract.
This will be  a blessing and it will
bring joy, not only to the people of these communities   but
all neighboring states such as Niger and Kwara.. While
we congratulate the Executive Governor of Kogi State on his re-election, we
wish to draw his attention  to  construction of many other roads that linked
the kupa community to the state capital, Lokoja such as Jamatta-Kakanda-Mami-Abugi-Eggan Road in Lokoja local govt. area of
kogi state Abdulmalik
