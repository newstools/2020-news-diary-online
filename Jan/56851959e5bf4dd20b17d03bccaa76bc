In his remarks, a traditional ruler in Sokoto, Alhaji Sani Umar, said that more people were now sensitized to speak out about cases of violence and abuse. “People used to hide cases of violence and abuse away from authorities, but recently people approach the authorities to report such cases,” he said. Umar commended the conveners of the meeting for providing a forum for a wake up call on issues of violence and abuse in the state. A member of the Kano State Council of Ulama, Sheik Sidi Sidi, called on lawmakers to enact laws to curb violence and abuse of women and children.
