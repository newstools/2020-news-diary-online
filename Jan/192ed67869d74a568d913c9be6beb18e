The
fourth prosecution witness, (PW4), Enu Matthew Obun, in the trial of
Ismaila Mustapha, better known as Mompha on Wednesday, January 15,
2020, told a Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos, presided over by Justice
Abdullahi M. Liman that the suspected internet fraudster ran an
illegal bureau de change with his company, Ismalob
Global Investments Limited. The
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC is prosecuting Mompha alongside
the company on a 14-count charge, bordering on cyber fraud and money
laundering to the tune of N33 billion (Thirty-three Billion Naira). Mompha,
who is the first defendant in the matter is alleged to have used the company to
launder funds, part of which he used to acquire properties in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates. Led
in evidence by prosecution counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, the witness, a compliance
officer with the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML), of the
EFCC, told the court that on November 15, 2019, the Commission requested from
SCUML the regulation and compliance status of the company and that “upon
inspection, it was discovered that Ismalob is not registered with the SCUML.” He
further stated that “From the database search in the office, there is no
information on Ismalob Global Investment Limited and all the transactions that
were done in the company’s account between December 14, 2015 and January 25,
2018 are not on SCUML’s record.” The
EFCC letter of request and the response from SCUML were admitted in evidence by
the court. Justice
Liman adjourned the matter until February 26, 2020 for continuation of trial.
