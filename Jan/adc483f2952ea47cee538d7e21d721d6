The
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Thursday, January 16, 2020,
asked Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke of the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos to
dismiss an application filed by former governor of Ekiti State Ayodele Fayose,
who is being prosecuted for alleged N2.2billion fraud. The
EFCC is prosecuting Fayose alongside his company, Spotless Investment Limited,
on an 11-count charge, bordering on fraud and money laundering to the tune of
N2.2billion. The
matter started before Justice Olatoregun, but was subsequently re-assigned to
Justice Aneke. At
the resumed sitting today, counsel to the defendant, Olalekan Ojo, SAN, told
the court that there is an interlocutory summons filed by the defendant on
December 2, 2019. Ojo
further stated that the move by the prosecution to call a fifth prosecution
witness, PW5, to give evidence in line with his extra-judicial statement was an
abuse of court process, adding that “he was previously not listed as a witness
in the matter, while it was before Justice Olatoregun.” Ojo
also urged the court to resolve the issue in favour of the defendant’s
application and grant the reliefs. Counsel
to the prosecution, Adebisi Adeniyi, in his response, submitted that there was
no abuse of court process on the prosecution seeking to call a prosecution
witness who was not earlier listed. “This
cannot be the basis why the defendant says the prosecution cannot call a
witness. Whatever happened with the former Judge is no longer relevant. The
matter has started afresh and this does not stop the prosecution from calling
another witness in its additional proof of evidence,” he stated. Adeniyi,
therefore, urged the court to dismiss the application and also impose a
substantial cost on the defence for attempting to waste the time of the court. Justice Aneke adjourned the matter to February 17, 2020, for ruling and continuation of trial. (EFCC Press release)
