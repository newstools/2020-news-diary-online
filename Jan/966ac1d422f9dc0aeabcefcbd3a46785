 The European Parliament has condemned attacks on humanitarian aid workers as insecurity, especially the Boko Haram terrorism, remains a major source of concern, among others. A statement the parliament said it “Condemns all attacks on humanitarian aid personnel or facilities, and urges measures to ensure the safety of aid workers and a secure environment for humanitarian organisations to carry out their essential work; Excerpts of the European parliament’s statement read thus: “A. whereas the security situation in Nigeria has significantly deteriorated in recent years, posing a serious threat to regional and international security; whereas human rights violations and mass killings are widespread, notably in the North-East Region of the country; whereas over 36 000 people have been killed by the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria since 2009; B. whereas the country is in its 10th year of a regionalised armed conflict; whereas violent extremism and terrorist activities, in particular, are on the rise, with jihadist groups, such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), growing in power and influence; whereas Boko Haram has attacked Nigeria’s police and military, politicians, schools, religious buildings, public institutions and civilians with increasing regularity since 2009; whereas the vast majority of victims are Muslims; C. whereas Nigeria ranks third out of 163 countries on the Global Terrorism Index behind Iraq and Afghanistan, making it the third in the list of countries most affected by terrorism; D. whereas the security situation has been aggravated by an escalation of religious and ethnic violence in some parts of the country, including the conflict in the agricultural Middle Belt, where farmers and nomadic herders are in conflict over land and water resources; E. whereas it is believed that ISWAP currently holds dozens of captives, including Christian leaders, security forces and aid workers; F. whereas Nigeria’s population, the most numerous in Africa, is almost equally distributed between Muslims and Christians; whereas the country is home to the region’s largest Christian community, with nearly 30 million Christians living in northern Nigeria; whereas historic rivalry between the predominantly Muslim north and Christian south has dramatically intensified with the spread of radical Islam; G. whereas ISWAP claimed responsibility for the execution of 11 people in a video released on 26 December 2019; whereas the group claimed all those killed were Christians, and that the attack was in retaliation for the death of IS leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi in Syria; H. whereas these killings are part of a wider series of terrorists acts, including the attack of 24 December 2019 on a Christian village near Chibok that resulted in the death of seven villagers and kidnapping of a teenage girl, the killing of three civilians outside Biu on 23 December 2019, and the killing of seven civilians in Nganzai on 22 December 2019; I. whereas according to the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust, over 6 000 Christians have been murdered since 2015 by jihadist groups or have perished as a result of the ‘your land or your blood’ policy carried out by Fulani militants; whereas in the Sharia States Christians face constant discrimination, and are often considered second-class citizens; J. whereas although President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the killings and urged the population not to become divided along religious lines, these attacks have been carried out with total impunity, with perpetrators rarely being held to account; whereas an Amnesty International report has demonstrated wilful negligence by the Nigerian Security Forces concerning the deadly attacks against farmers’ communities; K. whereas Human Rights Watch has reported that the Nigerian military has detained over 3 600 children, half of them girls, suspected of involvement with Islamist and non-state armed groups, often on the basis of little or no evidence; whereas many detainees have suffered abuse, including sexual violence, and have died in detention from disease, hunger, dehydration or gunshot wounds; whereas the military has systematically denied access to the detention facilities to verify the conditions in which children are held; L. whereas the situation of girls and women in Nigeria is especially problematic due to generalised discriminatory practices, limited access to health services and education, widespread female genital mutilation and child marriages; M. whereas the International Criminal Court (ICC) has stated that there are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute have been committed in Nigeria by Boko Haram and the Nigerian Security Forces (NSF), including murder and persecution; whereas in its 2019 Report on Preliminary Examinations, the ICC concludes that despite a number of steps taken by the Nigerian authorities towards ascertaining the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators, the investigative or prosecutorial steps undertaken to date in relation to members of Boko Haram and the NSF appear to have been limited both in scope and depth; N. whereas since 2015 the government has been criticised for its inadequate handling of the Islamic insurgency across the country; whereas Nigeria’s military and police are facing a myriad of security threats and appear overstretched and unable to tackle simultaneous security crises; O. whereas the Multinational Joint Task Force has driven terrorist groups out of many areas under their control since its establishment in 2015, though the region still remains highly unstable; whereas the recent withdrawal of 1 200 Chadian soldiers, coinciding with a surge of violence in the North-East Region, has caused concern among the population; whereas hundreds of Nigerian civilians installed nearby fled the area fearing new attacks by the jihadists after this withdrawal; P. whereas the EU, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) launched a project on Peace and Security Architecture and Operations (EPSAO) in October 2019; whereas the objective of the project is to strengthen ECOWAS mechanisms and capacity to manage conflict and support a postconflict environment in West Africa; Q. whereas the situation in Nigeria has caused an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and led to the displacement of more than 2 million people in the North-East, according to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); whereas according to Human Rights Watch most internally displaced people cannot exercise their basic rights to food, housing, education, health, protection from harm, as well as the right to freedom of movement; whereas the EU has allocated EUR 28,3 million to support humanitarian assistance in the country; whereas humanitarian aid needs are far from being met by current funds; R. whereas according to section of the Human Rights Watch World Report 2019 on Nigeria, over 35 000 internally displaced people returned to north-eastern communities in 2018 despite security concerns and the lack of basic necessities, including food and shelter; S. whereas nearly half of the Nigerian population live in extreme poverty; whereas it is estimated that over 7 million Nigerians are in urgent need of life-saving assistance; T. whereas thousands of Nigerians are risking their lives on the migration routes to the EU in the hope of living in better economic, social and security conditions; U. whereas the humanitarian space in the country has shrunk, with the kidnapping and killing of several aid workers; whereas eight aid workers were killed in 2019, part of a total of 26 who have lost their lives in the conflict since 2011; whereas security risks often hinder aid delivery and have caused the departure of many humanitarian organisations; V. whereas, furthermore, the Government has suspended a number of international aid agencies and charities, claiming they had been acting as money-launderers for Islamist groups; whereas in September 2019, the Nigerian Armed Forces requested the closure of Action Against Hunger and Mercy Corps without notice, leaving 400 000 people without access to aid; W. whereas under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the EU engages in regular political dialogue with Nigeria on human rights and democratic principles, including issues such as ethnic, religious and racial discrimination;
