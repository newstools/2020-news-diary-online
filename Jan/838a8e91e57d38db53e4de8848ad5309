An energy pressure group, Light for
the Masses (LIFOM), has alleged that elements within and outside the government
are sponsoring coordinated  attacks and are bent on frustrating the good
works of the Minister of Power, Eng Sale Mamman. The group said it’s privy to
all the plans to discredit the minister and ease him out so that the era of
impunity in the sector will continue. It stressed that it would soon expose
those sponsoring the attacks. Spokesperson of the group, Jaiyeola
Peters, noted further that the Minister’s traducers are spending millions of
tax payers money on wide scale negative propaganda and other forms of
intervention in top places. Augustine stressed that the increase
in attacks on the minister is sponsored. He said: “Nigerians are no longer
gullible. The fact is that the minister of power has come under attacks because
he embarked on doing the right thing at the right time. We are aware of the
plans. We even know those who are behind these attacks and we know the efforts
they are making. In fact, we have plans to expose them soon.” Augustine says the minister is on
the right track and that those fighting him are doing so to protect their
narrow interest. He said, “the minister has all the facts of the rot at
REA and NBET. As a matter of fact, even the anti graft agencies know the rot in
these places because they have all the petitions. So we now have a minister who
decided to act accordingly and do the needful and we have people saying he’s
wrong. Corruption is fighting back. Darkness is fighting back. But we are
behind the minister 100 percent.” He further admonished the minister,
urging him to continue to work for the masses. He said, “this minister
feels the pulse of the nation and he’s with the masses. So we are with him.
Those against him are those who want to keep ‘we the poor’ in darkness. And we
shall resist this.”
