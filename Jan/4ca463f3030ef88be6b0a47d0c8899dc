The increase in activities and threats by terrorist groups in the Sahel
region can be largely curbed by stepping up relations between Nigeria and the
United States of America, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.
Prof. Osinbajo stated this in Abuja on Thursday when he received the new US
Ambassador to Nigeria, Mrs Mary Beth Leonard, on a courtesy visit at the
Presidential Villa.
Noting the good relationship between Nigeria and the US, the Vice President
called for an even more robust cooperation.
He observed that apart from poverty, terrorism is a major issue affecting the
Sahel region and this is the best chance of making progress on those issues.
“Stepping up cooperation with the US in the area of counter-terrorism is
something that should be pursued vigorously given the threats of terrorism in
the Sahel,” according to the Vice President.   
Responding to the proposition by Mrs Leonard for improved ties between Nigeria
and US including through the restoration of the Bi-National Commission, Prof.
Osinbajo said there are indeed huge opportunities for improved cooperation
between both countries.
“The challenges facing us as a country are many but they present opportunities
for doing innovative and great things. This is our best chance to making
serious progress.
“I am certainly looking forward to the Bi-National Commission and hope that
important issues concerning our trade relations will be addressed because we
have barely scratched the surface,” the Vice President said.
Earlier in her remarks, the US Ambassador, Mrs Mary Beth Leonard said it was an
honour to serve in Nigeria and expressed hope that her tenure as Ambassador to
Nigeria would be fruitful.
The Ambassador said improving trade and investment and resuscitating the
US-Nigeria Bi-National Commission will top her agenda in the coming years.
