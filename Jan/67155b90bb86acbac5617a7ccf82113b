Lagos
State Government has described as false, the news making the rounds in some
quarters of the social media, claiming that it has destroyed the statues of
Nigerian music legend and social crusader, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti and the late
politician, Chief Obafemi Awolowo – both erected at the roundabout on Allen
Avenue in Ikeja. Speaking
to journalists on Thursday, the State’s Commissioner for Transportation, Dr.
Frederic Oladeinde who debunked the social media story said contrary to the
malicious claims being spread by ill informed individuals, the statues were
removed for the purpose of development. Oladeinde
said the need to carry out Junction improvements in some identified locations
necessitated the removal of street furniture, statues of very notable
personalities, art works and billboards. The
Commissioner noted that Lagos State Government holds the nation’s heroes in
very high esteem and would not do anything to bring down the exalted heights
they have attained during their lifetime directly or indirectly. He
said: “the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration, in a bid to finding a
lasting solution to traffic gridlocks in the State, identified about sixty
congestion points and have started work to improve traffic experience in five
major locations. Oladeinde
said the government duly informed and consulted the Fela Anikulapo-Kuti family
before the action was taken, noting that the whole process is for the benefit
of Lagos residents. The
Commissioner said the Fela statue will be relocated to the roundabout between Allen
Avenue and Opebi-Toyin Street. “We
are in the process of erecting the beautiful work of art, depicting Fela
Anikulapo-Kuti at the Opebi-Toyin street junction. The Ministry of Tourism,
Arts and Culture is also working on a befitting location to erect the old
Obafemi Awolowo statue,” he said.
