The Presidency has
in its  response to a statement by some
religious leaders, insisted that the Federal Government will not allow
religious intolerance in Nigeria. A statement
Tuesday signed by Mallam Garba Shehu, senior special assistant, media and
publicity to the president said, “This government shall never tolerate
religious intolerance. We clearly and unambiguously restate our support for the
freedom to practice whichever belief you wish. The politicisation of religion –
as forbidden by the constitution – has no place in Nigeria.” Excerpts of the
statement from the presidency reads thus: “The security forces of Nigeria are
working continuously to return those taken hostage by Boko Haram to their
families, friends and communities. In doing this, the government has full
confidence in their ability to accomplish the task. “On its own
part, government has condemned some of the appalling acts of terror, especially
following the festive period.  Yet, to continue to see these happenings
solely in religious terms – removed from social, economic and environmental
factors – simplifies complexities that must be heeded.  Not seeing them as
they should be is exactly what the terrorists and groups wish: they want
Nigerians to see their beliefs as reason to turn against one another. “On the contrary,
Christians and Muslims alike are united in their opposition to Boko Haram and
the hatred for decency that the infamous group stands for. “Nigerians must
continue to be united in ensuring that they do not subscribe to the terrorists’
message of division. Unfortunately, some leaders and politicians seek to make
political capital from our religious differences.  As we fight Boko Haram
on the ground, so too must we tackle their beliefs: stability and unity in face
of their hatred is itself a rejection of their worldview.”
