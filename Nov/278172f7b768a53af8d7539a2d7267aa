By Agbaji Chinedu Rice is an increasingly important crop in Nigeria. It is relatively easy to produce and is grown for
sale and for home consumption. In some areas there is a long tradition of rice growing, but for many, rice has been considered a luxury food for special occasions only. With the increased availability of rice, it has become part of the everyday diet of many in Nigeria. Nigerians spent not less than N1 billion daily on rice consumption, while spending had drastically reduced, consumption had increased because of increased local production of the commodity.
“The consumption rate now is 7.9 million tones and the production rate has increased to 5.8 tons per annum,’’This is as a result of CBN’s Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) with a total of 12 million rice producers and 4 million hectares of FADAMA rice land. Since inception of the program it has created economic linkage between Small Holder Farmers (SHF) and reputable large-scale processors, thereby increasing agricultural outputs and significantly improving capacity utilization of processors. The season has come, the first phase of rice harvest has started. this as a result has forced local rice price to come down from 26,000 to 22,500 and will still come down because many rice farmers will soon start harvesting.
