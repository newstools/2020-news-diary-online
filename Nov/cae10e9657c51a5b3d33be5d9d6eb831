Obaseki said the people of Edo spoke unequivocally through their ballots on Sept. 19 and ”have entrusted us with the task of steering our state for another four years. “I am encouraged by the truth you have bestowed on us and grateful for your belief in the leadership and my capacity to continue piloting the affairs of this great state.         “My re-election represents a new hope and I see myself as a vessel in the redefinition of democracy in Nigeria.
