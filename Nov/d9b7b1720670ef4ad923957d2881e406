An Associate Professor, Dr Tunde Adeoye of the Department of Economics, University of Lagos, has urged the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in the education sector. Adeoye made this known on Monday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Ota, Ogun. He spoke while reacting to the problems and prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Unions of Universities (ASUU) since Feb.23. NAN recalled that ASUU had embarked on an indefinite strike for more than eight months over the insistence of the Federal Government that its members must be enrolled in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). “The inability of the Federal Government to sufficiently fund the education system has necessitated the need to declare a state of emergency in the sector. “They should seek private sector assistance or collaboration to move the education system to the next level so as to improve the on the current decayed standard. “The Federal Government needs to reschedule its priorities by paying more attention to the educational system as a channel to achieving sustainable national development,” he said. Adeoye also called on the government to allocate more funds to educational system in the annual budget. NAN)
