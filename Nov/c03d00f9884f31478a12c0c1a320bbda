Justice Kabir Dabo of a High Court sitting in Dogarawa Zaria, Kaduna State has fixed Dec. 11, 2020 for pretrial conference in a suit challenging the appointment of the new Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Ahmed Bamalli. Aminu, in a writ of summons, wants the court to set aside the selection of the 10th defendant (the emir of Zazzau) by king makers on Sept. 24. Earlier, the Court Registrar Mr Jaafaru Abbas, invited all counsel and parties to the Judge’s Chambers. NAN reports that Aminu is seeking court to declare him the emir, having scored the highest votes cast by the kingmakers. NAN reports that on Nov.6, Justice Dabo refused an application seeking to stop the coronation of the Emir of Zazzau.          NAN reports that that on Oct. 16, Aminu filed an interlocutory application praying the court for an order of interim injunction restraining Gov. Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna from installing, crowning recognising and dealing with any person whosoever as the emir of Zazzau. Delivering a ruling, Justice Dabo, said:”due to the important roles played by traditional rulers in the society and likelihood of a breakdown in peace. ”Chieftaincy matters must be given accelerated hearing by courts in line with the reasoning of Supreme Court injunctions like this should be utterly discouraged.(NAN)
