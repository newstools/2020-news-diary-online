The Sector 7 Commander of OPSH, Col. David Nwakonobi disclosed this while receiving, Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan who visited the Sector 7 Headquarters on a working visit. Nwakonobi said:“We are happy to receive you and will want the government to know, that we have arrested three persons that phoned Ungwan Kwaki village in Jema’a local government to deliver fake news of an impending attack that caused panic.    “Troops tracked the phone used by the suspects and arrested Joel Luka, Emmanuel Daniel and Sylvester Daniel who claimed to be Fulani from Dangoma coming for an attack, which was later found out to be fake, contrary to the pandemonium that saw women, children and the aged being evacuated from the community.” He added that the suspects who are under-18 have confessed to be brain behind the fake news and will be handed over to the appropriate agencies.

He commended communities in the Southern Kaduna general area for the support given to security agencies, adding that government will continue to engage communities in peace building.
