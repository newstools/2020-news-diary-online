Mr Yemi Kale, the Statistician-General of the Federation says without sound statistical system not much progress can be made in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria. He made this assertion on Thursday in Abuja at the high-level dialogue on “Data bond and supply responsibility framework for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the sub-national level”. Kale, who was represented by Mr Adeyemi Adeniran, the Director, Real Sector and Household Statistics said that sound statistical system would help in producing timely and reliable data for government to plan and design its programmes. Kale said that in the present era, statistics and information technology makes planning much easier right from the sub-national level to the national level. According to him, for sustainable generation of quality and timely statistics, sustained cooperation and collaboration of all data gathering agencies in the country is needed. He, therefore, called on all producers of statistics at both the national and sub-national levels to embrace the spirit of collaboration and cooperation in statistics production. “Nigerian government at all levels require robust and reliable statistics to enable them effectively design programmes towards the implementation of the SDGs and monitor progress made in achieving the desired goals and targets. “At this point, the initiative of the SDGs Data Bond and Supply Responsibility Framework is a welcome development,” he said.
