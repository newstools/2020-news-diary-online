The Plateau Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has pledged regular training of public primary school teachers in the state to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. Prof. Mathew Sule, Board Chairman, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Jos. According to him, the quality of a learner is depended on the quality of the teacher, pointing out that the board will not compromise quality. “The quality of a learner is a reflection of the quality of the teacher. “As a board, we will continue to enhance the quality of our teachers with regular training.           The chair said the board would equip the teachers with modern knowledge and skills that would enable them to discharge their duties effectively. “We will continue to train them on all aspects of teaching techniques because we are after quality,” he said. Sule said the board has a proposal for special incentives for teachers working in rural areas, adding that the gesture would stimulate productivity and quality.         “Teachers deride rural areas because of the absence of social amenities, but teachers who are able to stay there would be motivated. “This is why we have developed a proposal in that regard and working towards ensuring that it comes to fruition,” he said.  (NAN)
