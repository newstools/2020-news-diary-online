Dr. Amos Cirfat, Provost, Federal College of Education, Pankshin in Plateau, said there was no cause for alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic in the institution. Cirfat disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday, in Pankshin. He gave the indication two weeks after the students of the college resumed for academic activities “So far, we haven’t received any report of ill-health regarding COVID-19 in the two weeks that the students have been in campus for academic activities. “I can confidently tell you that with the measures taken by the college management coupled with students’ cooperation, there is no cause for alarm. “We are equally very alert especially in the clinic where all is set for any eventuality. The staff operates 24 hours to all in the campus.           “Our hope is that the 400 Level and NCE III students being expected on Nov. 23, will not bring any issue. ”If we will continue like this, then we will be able to succeed as the college has achieved academic excellence,” he said. He said the college’s COVID-19 committee had been working tirelessly to ensure that all measures were put in place before resumption. According to him, the lockdown negatively affected the college as examination and payment of fees couldn’t be completed before its closure.           “In spite of the financial implication, we ensure that the entire college is fumigated, good ventilation in hostels and wash hands basins, soaps and water were placed in strategic places as part of measures to keep safe. “Our hope is to see students comply with the COVID-19 protocols and also cooperate with the security and staff to enjoy a virus free atmosphere for academic excellence,” he stated.
