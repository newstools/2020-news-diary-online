A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Jude Idimogu, on Friday commended Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi for defecting to the ruling APC. Idimogu (APC, Oshodi-Isolo Constituency II) and Deputy Apex Leader, Ndigbo in Lagos APC, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that Umahi’s defection from the PDP further cemented his belief that the political future of people of the southeast lies in the APC. The two-term lawmaker said that it was time politicians from the southeast embraced the ruling party to actualise their hopes and aspirations for the region. “Our party is a great party; APC is the hope. I thank God that one of our governors in the eastern states, Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi has defected to the ruling APC. “The truth is that the Igbo have better future in the APC as a party than in any other party. We thank God that Gov. Umahi has realised this and defected to our great party.          “This is to tell my other brothers and sisters that Igbo has future in the APC. I believe with time, that other bigwigs of Igbo extraction will join the APC. “This is what we want; this is a good thing. APC is the party to beat. APC is the party we should belong to. It is a party that will give Igbo a future after God. It is a party we must work for,’’ Idimogu said. According to him, all hands must be on deck to work for the ruling party for the Igbo to realise their dreams. NAN reports that Gov. Umahi defected to the APC on Tuesday along with some members of his cabinet, citing alleged injustice meted to the southeast by the PDP. (NAN)
