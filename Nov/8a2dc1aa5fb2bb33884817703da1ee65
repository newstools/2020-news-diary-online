INEC on Friday solicited the cooperation of all stakeholders for a successful outing at the bye-election of the Dass Constituency of the Bauchi State House of Assembly scheduled for Dec. 5. Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Bauchi State, made the appeal at a sensitisation and interactive session between the Commission and traditional rulers of the area. He particularly called on the traditional rulers to assist the Commission through sensitisation and mobilisation of their subjects toward the conduct of a free, fair and credible election. Abdullahi described the traditional institution as the custodian of peace, justice, unity and traditions. He said traditional rulers served as key stakeholders in the promotion of peace and the implementation of government’s policies and programmes.         Responding the Emir of Dass, Alhaji Usman Bilyaminu-Othman, in whose palace the event took place, assured the Commission of the unwavering determination and commitment of his council toward ensuring a crises-free bye-election. He said all traditional rulers in his domain would be fully sensitised to disseminate similar messages to their subjects.         He said that people of the area were known for peace, and noted that the recent local government election held in the area went without rancour or acrimony. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the bye-election is sequel to the killing by armed robbers of the assemblyman representing Dass, Musa Baraza (APC), in August. (NAN)
