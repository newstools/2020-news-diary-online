The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, has reiterated the commitment of Nigerian Army to revitalise all its schools to restore their glory. Buratai stated this at the opening of a Four-Day Workshop for Nigerian Army Education Corps Officers on Instructional and Professional Skills, organised by the Nigerian Army Resource Centre (NARC) on Monday in Abuja. The workshop, organised in conjunction with DEVTARG Ltd, had the theme, “Improving Class Teachers’ Instructional and Professional Skills for Enhanced Students’ Performance”. Buratai,  represented by the Chief of Administration (Army), Maj.-Gen. Usman Yakubu, said that Nigerian Army (NA) schools were graded among top schools in the country until  in the 1990s.          He said the schools were highly regarded due to their excellent academic performances, standard of discipline, top class facilities and sound administration backed by professional leadership. According to him, army schools are first choice destinations for children of service personnel, civilians and the general populace. “Regrettably, the gradual low standard of NA schools became noticeable in the last two decades, thereby compelling many service personnel and civilians alike to take wards to other schools. “Significant efforts have been made since 2015 to rebuild infrastructures, upgrade facilities, train teachers among others in order to reposition the schools.      “This endeavour is going to be a quarterly training programme designed to equip teachers and administrators of NA schools with modern tools in teaching and effective management of NA schools for improved performance,” he said. The COAS said that Army Education Corps in general and administration of the schools in particular must evolve with the environment, lest they become obsolete and irrelevant. “I urge all participants and organisers to give the workshop the serious attention it deserved with a view to fully maximise it for the overall restoration of the loss glory of NA schools,” he said. Earlier, the Director General of NARC, retired Maj.-Gen. Garba Wahab, said the workshop was designed to train the officers of the Nigerian Army Education Corps who are administrative officers and teachers of Nigerian Army Command Schools.       Wahab said the decision to train the officers was borne out of the fact that a lot of people no longer place their kids in army schools as they used to. He said the first workshop that was held for the commandants of education corps was already yielding results. He said the workshop was designed to also change mindsets and performance of the teachers toward enhancing the standard of army schools. (NAN)
