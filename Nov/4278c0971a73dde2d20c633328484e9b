A Customary Court sitting in Ikole Ekiti, Ekiti on Thursday dissolved two-year-old ”undefined relationship” between Lawrence Taiwo and his partner, Lola. Delivering judgment, the president of the court, Mrs Yemisi Ojo held that the union was dissolved on  grounds of constant fighting. ”Taiwo and Lola lived together for two years without legally marrying. So there is no union to dissolve. ”You are both advised to go your separate ways,” she said. Ojo ordered Lola to vacate Taiwo’s house on or before Nov. 19. Earlier, the petitioner, Taiwo, 65, in his testimony told the court that he never married Lola.            ”My two years with her was hellish. She prevented my children and family members from seeing me. ”I want the court to order her to leave my house,” he said. Responding, Lola, 50,told the court that Taiwo only wants her out of his life because he was with another woman. Lola pleaded for more time within which to move out of Taiwo’s house. (NAN)
