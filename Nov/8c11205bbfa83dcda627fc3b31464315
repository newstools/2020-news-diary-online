 The attention of the managemet of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has been drawn to an advertisement purportedly announcing ” NAN Recruitment 2020/2021 Application Form Portal – www.nan.ng” on a  certain media platform. This is to alert the public that the media outfit is at present NOT recruiting neither does it announce its recruitment plans on the social media.         Obviously, the purported vacancy advertisement is the handiwork of fraudsters determined to dupe unsuspecting Nigerians. NAN management has therefore, dissociated itself from the platform as it urges Nigerians to disregard the vacancy advertisement.
