The Edo State Ministry of Health has advised couples to imbibe family planning in order to give their children a better life. Mrs Patricia Osazuwa, Edo State Reproductive/Family Planning Coordinator, Edo Ministry of Health, gave the advice during a 3-Day training programme on Family Planning (FP)  which began on Monday in Benin. The News Agency of Nigerian NAN reports that the event is being organised by the ministry in collaboration with Development Community Networks, a non-governmental organisation. Osazuwa said that family planning would help them space their children and limit their number. She defined family planning  as “a process where individuals or couples decide and attain the number of children they want to have, the time and spacing between each birth”.          She said the objective of the family planning training was to build capacity of media practitioners on family planning, adolescents and youths’ sexual reproductive health. “Establishing platforms for creating more learning innovations for the adaptation and replication of media fora is very important. “Family planning in the home is very important. “It enables couples to give their children the basic needs such as food, shelter, education, and a better future,” She said.         According to her, family planning gives times and attention to the family and improves financial status. She said that the most effective methods to prevent unintended pregnancy include withdrawal methods, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants. She encouraged couples to imbibe family planning in order to give enough time and opportunity to love and provide attention for their children. (NAN)
