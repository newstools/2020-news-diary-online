Emmanuel Umar, the state’s Commissioner for Youths and Sports Development, disclosed this in Minna while inaugurating an eight-man committee to work out the modalities. “Gov. Abubakar Bello has approved that the ministry start a national marathon in the state. “Consequent upon this is the inauguration of the Shiroro National Marathon Local Organising Committee,” he said. Umar said the committee would decide whether the annual event would be an open or invitational marathon. He said that the committee would also come up with a schedule regarding when the marathon would hold. The Commissioner said the committee’s terms reference include organising a befitting marathon, sourcing for funds or looking for sponsorship and coming up with a budget.
