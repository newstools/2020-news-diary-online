A Kaduma Chief Magistrates’ Court on Thursday ordered that a 30-year-old farmer, Ishak Aminu, who allegedly defiled his neighbour’s five-year-old daughter be remanded in a correctional centre. The police charged Aminu, who resides in Durumi Village Makarfi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with defilement. The Chief Magistrate, Benjamin Hassan, did not take Aminu’s plea for want of jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Hassan ordered the police to return the case file to the Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. He adjourned the matter until Nov. 17.         Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Insp. Chidi Leo, told the court that Aminu committed the offence  on Oct. 28 in his residence. Leo said that Aminu lured the five-year-old girl into his room and defiled her. He said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 209 of the Penal Code Law of Kaduna State, 2017.(NAN)
