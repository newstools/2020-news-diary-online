Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State says the state government has concluded plan to pay the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) examination fees for students in public schools in the state. Akeredolu disclosed this on Thursday in Akure during a courtesy visit by the national leaders of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) . The governor said the decision to pay the fees was part of his administration’s desire to alleviate the financial burden of parents in educating their children. He explained that the resources at the disposal of the state at the moment were limited, but, his administration would endeavour to source the needed funds for the successful implementation of the policy. Akeredolu said he was aware that quite a number of parents were finding it difficult to pay the terminal examination fees. “The Commissioner for Education and his team have met with me on the policy. I have told them to get prepared for its implementation. “In fact, we have to delay the announcement till now so that some people won’t tag our genuine intention as a political ploy to curry the votes from our people,” he said. Earlier, Revd. Felix Omobude, National President, PFN, praised Akeredolu for the various life changing projects and policies in state. “The people of Ondo State voted for you for a second term in office as a result of your masses oriented policies. I therefore congratulate you, Mr Governor,” Omobude said. The cleric, who was accompanied by some members of the Advisory Council Members of PFN, enjoined leaders in positions of authority to continually lead with the fear of God and honesty of purpose.
