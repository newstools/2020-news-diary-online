Gov. Mai Mala-Buni of Yobe has approved N73.8 million, for reactivation of the state fertiliser blending plant in Gujiba. The state’s Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Tourism, Alhaji Barma Shettima said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Damaturu on Friday. He said the approval followed the signing of a contract  between the government  and Basewatch Concept Nigeria Ltd., for the resuscitation of the plant on Nov. 18, in Damaturu. Shettima said reviving the plant would help create jobs for youths in the state as well as save billions of naira expended on fertiliser importation annually. “The company is capable of producing fertiliser at affordable rate to meet the demands of our farmers and those in other states.          “It will also enable the state to key into the Federal Government’s Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) aimed at growing the economy through production of NPK 20-20 fertiliser using locally sourced materials. “ By keying into the initiative, the state stands to generate more revenue for development projects,” he said. The commissioner commended the governor for the approval and urged the contractor to speed up the work. The fertiliser plant is the fourth moribund company to be reactivated by Mala-Buni led administration since assumption of office in 2019. Others are the Damaturu woven sack and leather company, the Potiskum floor mills and feeds company and the Potiskum aluminum company.(NAN)
