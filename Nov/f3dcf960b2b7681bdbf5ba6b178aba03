By Chimezie Godfrey Military airstrikes have neutralised dozens of Islamic State for West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters in Borno State. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Defence Headquarters Abuja, Maj Gen. John Enenche disclosed this on Thursday. Enenche said,”In continuation of the sustained offensive against terrorist elements in the North East zone of the Country, the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has neutralized several Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters  at Doron Naira on the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno State. “This was achieved through air strikes executed on 24 November 2020 after series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions indicated that the location was used as the staging area from where the terrorists launched recent attacks against friendly locations in and around Baga. “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships, dispatched by the Air Task Force to the location, took turns in engaging the target area, hitting the terrorists in their hiding places under the dense vegetation and neutralizing dozens of them. “Some of the ISWAP elements, who were attempting to flee the location, were taken out in follow-on attacks.”
