A Federal High Court in Ibadan has ordered a 37-year-old drug peddler, Segun Ibrahim to be remanded at the correctional centre over unlawful dealing in 2.5 kg of Indian Hemp. In her ruling, Justice Patricia Ajoku gave the order after Ibrahim pleaded guilty to the one-count charge of unlawful dealing in Indian Hemp leveled against him.               She adjourned the case until Nov. 23, for presentation of facts and judgment. When the charge was read to him, Ibrahim wasted no time in pleading guilty to the charge, while begging the court to temper justice with mercy.
