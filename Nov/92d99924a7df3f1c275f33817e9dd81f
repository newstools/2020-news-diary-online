The acting Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Air Vice Marshal Ahmed Mu’azu (retired) on Monday in Abuja, swore-in Dr Joseph Chukwuemeka as Resident Electoral Commission (REC). Mu’azu, while carrying out his first official assignment as acting chairman of the commission, said that Chukwuemeka who is from Abia State has been deployed as REC for Ebonyi.    He said he has no doubt that Chukwuemeka would discharge his responsibilities according to the oath of office that he took. The acting chairman charged him to be neutral and act within the laws and regulations guiding his office and work of the commission. “You are nominated and confirmed based on your pass records, please stick to the mandate and core values of this commission.” Mu’azu said.    Responding, Chukwuemeka commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his nomination as INEC REC. He, however, pledged to discharge his role intelligently and promote Nigeria’s democracy. (NAN)
