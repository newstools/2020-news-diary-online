President Muhammadu
Buhari has condemned the latest round of attacks on farmers by bandits in
Damkal and Tsanwa villages in Batsari local government area of Katsina state,
saying that killing people in the name of revenge is not acceptable. Garba Shehu, Senior
Special Assistant to the President on media and publicity said in a press
release  that while reacting to the incident in which many homesteads were
razed by fire with many people killed at weekend, the President on Sunday warned that “no one in the country has a
right to take laws into his hands by the way of self-help or revenge. Local
communities that catch bandits should hand over the suspects to law enforcement
authorities instead of meting out capital punishment, leading to a cycle of
revenge and counter revenge.” He urged community
leaders and the local authorities to continue their efforts in partnership with
law enforcement agencies that bring the surrender of bandits, leading to peace
between farmers and herders. “The authorities
must be allowed to investigate and deal with any breach that occurs. There is
no place for violence in a decent society,” said the President. Buhari prayed that God will comfort families that have lost loved ones in the attacks and repose the souls of the victims.
