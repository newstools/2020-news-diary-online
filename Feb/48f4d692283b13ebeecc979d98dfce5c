President
Muhammadu Buhari has described the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme
as a laudable one that needs to be sustained as it affords the opportunity for
Nigerian youths to understand the country better. “People
come from far and wide; some from Victoria Island in Lagos have not
even been to Ikeja. They now find themselves in Daura and other
parts of the country. Whenever I go to my town, I get in touch with members;
some of them from Lagos, some from Port Harcourt,” he stated. President
Buhari who said this
Thursday in Abuja while playing host to corps members who came on
a thank-you visit to him, also praised General Yakubu Gowon for the initiative. “Whenever
I meet General Gowon up till today, I thank him for initiating the NYSC. It is a
nationalist and patriotic thinking that led to the development of the
scheme,” he added Four
members representing others countrywide came to convey their “deepest
gratitude” to the President over the recent increase in their monthly
allowances from N19,800 to N33,000. According
to them, “the implementation in January, when we least expected it brought
tears of joy to us as we had doubts of the promises earlier made.” “You
have demonstrated that you are a loving and caring father committed to the
welfare of his children,” they added. They
also reiterated their commitment to do their best during their period in the
scheme. “The increase is a wake-up call to us to show more commitment to
the affairs of our fatherland. We are great stakeholders in our collective
determination of building a prosperous and united Nigeria, the future belongs
to us.” The
NYSC members were led to the State House by the Minister of Youth and Sports
Development, Sunday
Dare and the Director General of the scheme Brigadier General Ibrahim Shehu.
