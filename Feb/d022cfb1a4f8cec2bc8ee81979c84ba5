Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE, under the auspices of Operation
RATTLE SNAKE 3, have continued to yield tangible results against terrorist
elements in the Northeast of the Country. Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, Director
of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force who disclosed this
in  a statement said  the latest of these was achieved on 20
February 2020 in attacks conducted at Jubillaram and Alinwa in the Northern
part of Borno State, where some key Islamic State of West Africa Province
(ISWAP) leaders were neutralized as they assembled for meetings at the 2
locations. 

According to the NAF spokesman, the mission was executed on the heels of
credible intelligence reports indicating that some key ISWAP leaders had
assembled for meetings, which were being held simultaneously at 2 separate
venues, at Jubillaram and Alinwa in Marte Local Government Area. Accordingly,
the ATF scrambled its attack aircraft to engage both locations, damaging the
meeting venues and neutralizing the terrorists. The NAF, operating in concert with
surface forces, will sustain its air campaign to shape the battlespace in the
Northeast for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations, Daramola
