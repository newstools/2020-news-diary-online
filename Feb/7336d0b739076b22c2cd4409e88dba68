Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, on Monday called for synergy among all security agencies, to re-strategize and re-examine the security structure with a view to stem the rising cases of terrorism in Nigeria. Mrs Buhari made the call at an international conference on state and security held at the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) Kaduna. The conference was organised by the NDA Centre for Critical Thinking, Teaching and Learning. She stressed the need for government to look into the welfare of security personnel, saying that it plays a vital role in the way and manner they carry out their mandate. “Security in Nigeria remains the biggest challenge, it is high time to explore new strategies and approaches, if care is not taken, we will be expecting the worse of the security problems we are facing in Nigeria,” she said. The president’s wife urged Nigerians to remain vigilant and provide relevant information to security agencies to avert any potential threat to peace and security in the country. “All criminals are members of our society and they live in our midst, parents have the responsibility of ensuring that we take exceptional interest in the development of our children,”she added. Mrs Buhari commended the role played by women at ensuring safety of Nigerian children. “It is our responsibility as women to fast track our activities to make our families stronger. “We remain the pivots and motivators that must continue to moderate the bond of unity and affection in our various families,” she added. Earlier, the Commandant of NDA, Maj.-Gen. Jamil Sarham, represented by his Deputy, AVM Ibrahim Ali, said the conference was organised to proffer solutions to the challenges of insecurity in Nigeria. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Pauline Tallen, the DGs of NYSC, DICON, and SSS, as well as the Deputy Governor of Kaduna state, Hadiza Balarabe, among other stakeholders attended the conference.(NAN)
