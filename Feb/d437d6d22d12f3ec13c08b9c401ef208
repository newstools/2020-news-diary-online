Ex-Minister of Education, Olorogun Kenneth
Gbagi, has commended the President of the Court of Appeal, Hon. Justice Zainab
Adamu Bulkachuwa, for her unwavering commitment to ensuring swift
administration of justice in Nigeria. Gbagi, in a statement issued to the media on
Monday, gave the commendation against the backdrop of the establishment of a
Court of Appeal Division in Asaba, Delta State. According to the former Chairman of the Legal
Aid Council of Nigeria, making justice accessible remains fundamental to
strengthening democracy, fostering due process and deepening the rule of law. He said, “Laws are the most viable instruments
of social engineering, and same must operate for the common good of the people. “To effect this, the requisite mechanisms,
structures and apparatus must be put in place, as making justice more
accessible to the people remains a fundamental threshold upon which democracy,
the rule of law, and due process thrive. “In an era where the search for justice has
become increasingly indispensable, the President of the Court of Appeal has, by
her mandate, made it possible for litigants in Delta state to pursue their
cases without having to necessarily travel to the neighbouring states to file
or have their appeals heard. “Citizens of Delta State are overwhelmed with
joy and grateful to the President of the Court of Appeal for keeping to her
promises. “This affirms the commitment of the judiciary
towards efficient, swift and seamless administration of justice in Nigeria,”
Gbagi added. He
further admonished citizens of Delta State to collectively continue to support
the Okowa-led administration.
