A
bench warrant has been issued by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High
Court in Abuja for the arrest of a former Comptroller-General of Customs,
Abdullahi Inde Dikko, to ensure his attendance in court to take his plea on the
next adjourned date for his arraignment by the Independent Corrupt Practices
and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) on fraud charges. This
was sequel to an application brought by ICPC prosecution counsel, E. A.
Shogunle, when another scheduled arraignment could not hold due to the absence
of the accused person in court. Justice
Ojukwu  granted the Commission’s prayer over  continued failure of
the former Comptroller-General to attend court for his arraignment. While
ordering Dikko’s arrest, Justice Ijeoma noted that his lawyer, Solomon Akuma
(SAN) who, on the last adjourned date, had assured the court that his client
was going to be present in court only turned around to present a medical report
claiming that he was critically ill and on admission in London. The
judge also ordered that if in the execution of the bench warrant it is
discovered that the accused was actually ill and receiving treatment in a
London hospital, then the execution shall be suspended, otherwise the
prosecution should arrest him and produce him in court on 16th March, 2020
which is the next adjourned date for arraignment. Dikko,
alongside two others, Garba Makarfi and Umar Husseini, is facing multiple
charges that include defrauding the Managing Director of Cambial Limited, Mr.
Yemi Obadeyi of N1.1 billion.
