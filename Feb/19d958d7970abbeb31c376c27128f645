By Chimezie Godfrey In order to ensure transparency, greater efficiency and prudent application of resources, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, has started the process of overhauling of the National Social Investment Programmes (NSIPs). Disclosing this in statement made available to Newsdiaryonline on Saturday, the Minister, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq, said the process of overhauling the Programmes would involve observing and enforcing due diligence in NSIPs processes, to ensure full compliance with extant regulations and best practices in public sector financial transactions. “To that effect, all present processes especially beneficiary enrolment and payments including for consultancies are being scrutinized and stakeholders are being consulted for inputs that will lead to the total overhaul of the programmes in order to achieve the purposes for which they were established. “Similarly , the Ministry will place all transactions under the microscope to ensure that the massive resources which the present Administration is channeling to place in the hands of the most vulnerable groups in the country reach them instead of ending in the pockets of middle men or double-dealers, who while receiving payments from the specific programmes also take up other paid jobs,” she said. Farouq pointed out that the Ministry is working to ensure that beneficiaries of all NSIPs designed to be exited after specified periods, will be prepared through the best of the options presently under consideration by the government. “It is hereby emphasised that the Ministry is determined to give maximum effect to the laudable decision of government to institutionalize the NSIPs, the implementation of which is costing the government billions of Naira annually. “The Ministry acknowledges that this effort to overhaul the programmes may temporarily slow down the tempo of implementation and will certainly not go down well with vested interests sure to be frustrated with the new direction, and who may therefore resort to the use of traditional and new media as well as misdirected public advocacy to distract government and derail the process. “The Ministry is therefore appealing for maximum understanding and cooperation of all stakeholders and appeals to any misinformed members of the public to desist from actions that may distract the Ministry from discharging this important national mandate or even delay the implementation of these life-changing programmes,” she stated. The Minister stressed that the Ministry and its agencies will continue to render services to Nigerians in humanitarian situations effectively, deliver relief to those affected by disasters, evolve and implement policies that drive social development. She added that this will facilitate economic inclusion for the benefit of the most vulnerable in the country especially through the N-Power, Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP), Conditional Cash Transfer as well as the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme and other programmes rolled out by the present administration.
