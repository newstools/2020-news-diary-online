The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has alleged that the All Progressives Congress (APC), is currently mounting pressure on the Supreme Court to restrain itself from reversing the flawed judgment on the Imo governorship election. It also claims that the alleged pressure is in spite of “obvious mistakes in that judgement, which is now threatening the stability of our nation.” This is contained in a statement by the Spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan and posted on its website on Wednesday. According to the PDP, its “demand on Imo is not in any way in contestation of the authority and finality of the Supreme Court, but a patriotic effort to assist the Supreme Court affirm its infallibility by correcting the inherent mistakes in the judgment, which came as a result of misleading presentation to it by the APC. “It is therefore instructive to note that the various election matters before the Supreme Court, were brought on clearly distinctive grounds and each should be treated on its merit before the law,” the statement read. It said “the only reason APC was pushing for a review of the Supreme Court’s valid and flawless judgment on the Bayelsa and Zamfara governorship elections, was to cause confusion and blackmail the Supreme Court from treating the Imo case on merit.” The party maintained that “the grounds for the reversal of Imo judgment are unambiguously constitutional and completely distinct from APC’s attempt to blackmail the Supreme Court with their demands on the Bayelsa and Zamfara states governorship election.” The PDP urged the Supreme Court” not to succumb to the threats and blackmail by APC to push it to restrain itself from looking at the merit of the Imo case; correcting the mistakes and reversing the flawed judgment.”
