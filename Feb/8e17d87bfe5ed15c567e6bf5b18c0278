The Presidency has described the leader of Northern Elders Forum, NEF and former Vice Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Professor Ango Abdullahi as a paper tiger. Presidential Spokesman,Femi
Adesina who made this assertion in a statement Sunday said, “NEF is merely
waving a flag that is at half-mast. President (Muhammadu) Buhari steadily and
steadfastly focuses on the task of retooling Nigeria, and discerning Nigerians
know the true state of the nation. They don’t need a paper tiger to tell them
anything.” The statement came on the
heels of Abdullahi’s position on the state of the nation especially the north. Reacting to Abdullahi’s  statement, Adesina said “Professor Ango
Abdullahi on Sunday signed a long-winding statement on many issues relating to
the North, and purportedly to the country. “The former vice
chancellor signed the statement under the banner of Northern Elders Forum
(NEF). Hearing that title, you would think the body was a conglomeration of
true elders. But the truth is that  NEF is just Ango Abdullahi, and Ango
Abdullahi is NEF. It is a quasi-organization that boasts of no credible
membership, and its leader is akin to a General without troops. “Before the 2019
presidential election, the one-man army called NEF had shown its antipathy
against President Muhammadu Buhari, and its preference for another candidate.
They all got beaten together.”
