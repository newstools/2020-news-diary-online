Senator Douye Diri of the Peoples Democracy Party (PDP)  on Friday took oath of office as Governor of
Bayelsa. Chief Judge of the 
State, Justice Kate Abiri, administered the oath of office for the
Bayelsa governor, and his Deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo. Newsdiaryonline reports that APC national chairman, Adams
Oshiomhole had earlier  boasted that
nobody  would be sworn in because,  according to him, PDP’s Diri did not meet the
legal requirements. Despite his  assertion,
INEC  National Chairman, Professor
Mahmood Yakubu declared Diri the Governor -elect Friday, thus paving the way
for the swearing in of a new governor after the Supreme Court Thursday annulled
the victory of APC Candidates. The swearing-in ceremony which took place at the Government
House, Yenagoa, was a huge celebration among party supporters. In an inauguration address, 
Diri declared that he would always work to achieve peace, love and
prosperity for the people. He described the swearing in day, as “a day made by God and
marvelous in the eye of the people of Bayelsa”. “I have been sworn in today as your new governor, my advice
is that we have to be magnanimous in victory. “We have to forget the bitterness and  acrimony, because if we kill ourselves, who
are we going to lead? Of course, we are not going to  lead animals. “I, therefore, bring to you message of love, hope and
prosperity for Bayelsa. “Let us eschew all the bitterness and acrimony and learn to
love ourselves irrespective of political parties,” Diri stated. (With report by
