Ahead of the July implementation of the African Free Trade
Agreement (AFTA), the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has appealed to the
National Orientation Agency (NOA) to step up its public enlightenment
activities to educate entrepreneurs and border communities on the impending
challenges which the policy will come along with. The AFTA opens our borders to products of other
African countries without import duty and will open the flood gates for intense
competition with local products and services. The Comptroller General of Customs (CGC), Col. Hameed
Ibrahim Ali who received the Director General of NOA, Dr. Garba Abari on a
courtesy visit yesterday explained that Nigerians, particularly the border
communities, need to be educated on the dangers of illicit products importation
and use as well as the need to cooperate with Customs in its operations. He said the technical nature of the NCS mandate
requires daily education of Nigerians on issues of trade facilitation, import
prohibitions, customs and excise charges, thereby necessitating collaboration
with NOA in the area of advocacy, given the Agency’s nationwide spread. He
therefore solicited NOA’s increased advocacy to relevant stakeholders ahead of
AFTA implementation and directed all Customs Commands to participate fully and
actively in NOA public sensitization programmes. The NOA Director General, Dr. Abari stressed the need
for government policies to be explained in local languages that citizens can
understand to secure popular buy-in and enable the formation of informed
perspectives. This approach, he noted, has been adopted by the NOA in its
sensitization on border closure which, he said, has now yielded an overall
positive disposition by the majority of Nigerians towards the policy.
Dr. Abari said the visit was to explore areas of
collaboration for the benefit of Nigerians and the economy, including a Patronize
Made in Nigerian Goods campaign that has been flagged by the NOA
