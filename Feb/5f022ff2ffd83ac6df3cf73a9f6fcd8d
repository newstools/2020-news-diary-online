PDP. “The Lords Justices have given us another opportunity to show Nigerians that
power belongs to the people, and we must make good use of this opportunity,”he
said. Abubakar said that he received the verdict of the court, declaring the
candidate of the PDP, Diri, as the duly elected governor of the state, with
gladness. ” Diri had cause to visit me before the elections, and received my blessings
and counsel. “I am fully satisfied that he has what it takes to make Bayelsa the ‘glory
of all lands. His intellect, personality and character, are a credit to Bayelsa
and the PDP, ” he said. Abubakar called on all the people of Bayelsa to make peace with the recent
past, and embrace the future together, united in the mission to transform the
state into a haven of peace and prosperity. “Finally, I urge the supreme court to show consistency in its judgments and
find the resolve to always deliver just judgments no matter whose ox is gored. “The people of Nigeria are behind the apex court in whatever they do to free
themselves from the dominance of dictatorial forces,” he added. (NAN)
