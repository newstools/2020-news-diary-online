 The Kwara State
Commissioner for Water Resources, Hajia Arinola Lawal has described as
worrisome the vandalisation of Osi Waterworks in Ekiti local government area of
the state. The commissioner made the
condemnation at the weekend while speaking with Journalists during her
assessment tour to Osi andÂ Oko communities in Ekiti LG to ascertain the
condition of water supply in the areas. According to her, the
present administration would no longer condone any vandalisation of public
properties in the state. It would be recalled that
in 2017 some miscreants stormed Osi waterworks and carted away all equipment
meant for the supply of pipe borne water to the communities. She described the
vandalisation as very unfortunate, stressing that nemesis would soon catch up
with the perpetrators of the act. The commissioner, however,
attributed the unfortunate incident to carelessness and negligence on the part
of the past administration and their failure to secure the dam. She added that the present
situation of the dam calls for concern of the ministry and other authority and
called for a change of attitude towards public properties. Ms Lawal and her entourage
used the visit to pay homage to the Palace of Olosi of Osi, Oba Abdulkareem
Adasofegbe Arowobeku 1, where she informed the monarch about the present
situation of the dam. She urged the monarch to
use his position to plead with the people of the community to support
government in securing its properties in their various communities. She reiterated the
commitment of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq towards the provision of adequate
water supply to all the nooks and crannies of the state. Responding, Olosi of Osi,
expressed his appreciation to Governor AbdulRahman and the commissioner for the
visit. The monarch pleaded with
the state governor to repair Osi waterworks, as he assured government of the
readiness of the community to secure and protect the dam as well as all
government properties within the community.
