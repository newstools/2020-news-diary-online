Minister
of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, this
afternoon (18/2/2020) received the draft report of the National Broadband Plan
Committee 2020-2025. The
report was presented to him in his office by the Chairman of the Committee, Ms
Funke Opeke, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), MainOne Cable. The
Committee is co-chaired by Dr. Bashir Gwandu, former Executive 
Commissioner Technical Services at NCC, while Engr. Ubale Maska, NCC’s
Executive  Commissioner Technical Services is the Secretary of the
Committe. In
attendance at the presentation ceremony today were members of the Committee.
The Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of NCC, Prof. Danbatta was also present at
the event. Dr.
Pantami inaugurated the Committee on 16 December 2019 to develop a new National
Broadband Plan 2020-2025 that will be a guiding template for further
development of the telecommunications sector. This
followed the expiration of the 2013-2018 National Broadband Plan which was
designed to achieve at least 30 percent broadband penetration in Nigeria. At
the expiration of the old Plan, Nigeria achieved 37.8 percent broadband
coverage. At
the inauguration of the new NBP Committee, Pantami also urged the members to
review the old plan, examine its challenges and proffer solutions. He equally
urged the committee to undertake the assignment in the context of growing and
emerging technologies. The
new broadband plan, being developed with the support and collaboration of the
Government of the United Kingdom (UK), is expected to increase broadband
penetration to 70 percent by 2025 in order to give concrete expression to
Federal Government’s commitment to making Nigeria a truly digital
economy. It
will be recalled that on January 3, 2020, while engaging the Nigerian press at
a Media Briefing and Chat, Dr. Pantami promised that the report of the new
NBP Committee will be ready in the first quarter of the year 2020.
