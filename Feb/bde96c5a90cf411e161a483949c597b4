By Chimezie Godfrey The Director General, National
Orientation Agency (NOA), Dr Garba Abari has said  that rising cases of killing in Nigeria should
not be  misconstrued as  war between  Muslims and Christians. Dr Abari stated this Tuesday in
Abuja during a media parley on the activities of the agency in the month of
January, 2020. He attributed the negative narrative
painting the killings and insecurity in the country with  religious coloration,
as handwork of enemies of the Nigerian people. He however, revealed that government
has taken steps in order to tackle the challenge of insecurity in the country. “With regard to the spate of
banditry in some parts of the country especially in Niger State, government has
deployed the Airforce in addition to combat troops in the area. “Let me also emphasis that the
whole effort by enemies of our people is to put us against ourselves based on
religious and ethnic lines. “We should respond as a United
people. What we are experiencing now is not between Moslems and Christians, it
is an assault against our collective civilization,” he said. The DG stressed that the security
situation in the country has been a concern to the agency. “We are concerned by the rising
cases of killing around the country, it is actually worrisome that at this
period, killing is targeted at both the young and  the old, the religious
and the lay person. “Acknowledge the tension in the
country over security problems and I hope with all Nigerians, we will find
solutions to the problem. “Government is also concerned
about the situation. Recall that the President has met severally with service
chiefs over the matter I believe soon, a comprehensive response will come into
operation,” he said.
