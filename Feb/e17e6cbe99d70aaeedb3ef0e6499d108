 By Haruna Salami Senate Committee on Ecology and
Climate Change has rejected the report presented to it by National Oil Spill
Detection and Response Agency, NOSDRA at an investigative hearing  on
Thursday for inconsistence and conflicting figures. The committee was taking an
“overview of internally generated revenue, IGR, lodgement to Treasury
Single Account, TSA, 2021 projection and details of projects &
contractors/2019 implementation status” of the agency. Trouble started when the DG could
not explain payment made for contract awarded in 2017, payment made so far to
the contractor and the balance to be paid. The chairman of the committee,
Senator Hassan Muhammad Nasiha became upset when the DG could not give exact
figure, to the dismay of the committee. The committee also found the way the
report was prepared as unacceptable and asked the Director
General, Idris O. Musa whether he has competent staff under him. In his contribution, Senator Ibrahim
Danbaba, (Sokoto South), a member of the committee said as a former civil
servant himself, he found the report very poor and unserious, adding, we are
not playing here. He asked the DG whether he read the report before presenting
it to the committee. All the DG could say was to offer
apologies, but this did not appease the committee, which asked the DG to get
serious and take responsibility. He was then asked to go back, prepare the
report well and appear before the committee next Thursday. That will be the
fourth appearance before the committee
