Sunday said the apex court has a duty to redeem itself from the embarrassment
of having been misled by contrived, incorrect and fraudulent figures pertaining
to the 388 Polling Units which the candidate of the All Progressives Congress
(APC) canvassed in court. The group said facts and data from
the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) provide evidence to the
effect that over-voting occurred in no less than 226 of the 388 Polling Units
“wherein INEC has consistently maintained that election was either cancelled or
did not hold at all. “This approximates to about
80percent of the results of the said units dumped on the court and on which basis
the Election Petition Tribunal and the Appeal Court rightly dismissed them for
not having any probative value.” The group further said the facts
from INEC “incontrovertibly demonstrates evidence of over-voting apart from
other cases of electoral fraud which have been variously exposed in the media
space since the controversial judgment was made. “It is therefore incumbent on the
Supreme Court to rise to the occasion and save the integrity and sanctity of
the judiciary as the last hope of the common man. And of course, more
importantly, save our democracy and the image of Nigeria which has been brought
to great odium by the earlier judgment.” The group buttressed its argument  with the following graphics. Click to view
