The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)
has been honoured with “Outstanding Partnership” award by the
Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). The Association said it was gratified by the
support, collaboration and partnership with the Commission and the great
strides the Commission has accomplished as the national regulatory authority
for telecommunication in Nigeria. Glory Idehen, President of the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT) Chapter of ISACA, referenced activities of the Commission as
the regulator of the telecoms, a sector that has enabled growth in other
sectors of the economy. Idehen said ISACA is particularly happy to be
associated with NCC. The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar
Danbatta, who was represented by Abraham Oshadami, Head Information Technology
at NCC, thanked ISACA for the award. Danbatta noted that as a leading public
sector organisation regulating telecoms, NCC takes information technology
governance as critical. Accordingly, the EVC stated that it is just
natural that NCC was able to relate warmly with ISACA which is also focused on
information technology governance. The EVC expressed gladness that some staff
of the Commission are also members of ISACA and hope that ISACA will continue
to encourage professional capacity building among the nation’s workforce. The Information Systems Audit and Control
Association (ISACA) is an international not-for-profit professional body with
over 200 chapters globally. The Association is reputed for the development and
use of information technology systems knowledge and practices to enhance
efficiency in corporate governance structures.
