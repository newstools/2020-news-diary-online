The All Progressives
Congress Progressive Youth Council has vowed to reveal the identities of its
members in the National Assembly behind the call for President Muhammadu
Buhari’s resignation. The group gave this
warning at a press conference in Abuja on Monday on the nefarious activities of
some APC members who are behind this inglorious call. In a statement signed
by President, Alhaji Sanusi Sheriff, the APC youth wing cautioned those
distributing monies to lawmakers in order to oust President Buhari to
desist. According to Alhaji
Sheriff, those behind the plot are desperate politicians hiding in the National
Assembly to pursue their dream of becoming Vice President anytime soon. The APC youths
expressed disappointment with some of its members for succumbing to betray the
president and the party and even more shocked with the NASS leadership for
allowing such a travesty to take place in the first place. The APC Progressive
Youth Council, therefore, vowed not to hesitate to expose those behind the call
for the invitation of President Buhari to appear before the National Assembly. The group believes the
president’s achievements speaks for itself and no amount of mischief can bring
him down. The APC youths,
however, advised the NASS leadership not to allow itself to be used as a wiling
tool for the destabilization of Nigeria by disgruntled elements.
