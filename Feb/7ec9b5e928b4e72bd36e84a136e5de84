Lesley M. Otu The Nigerian Airforce appeared before the joint House Committee on Work and Justice based  on the complaint brought by Blue Boulevard Limited, a building construction company. The case was called for first
hearing Tuesday, February 2020 for submission of claims at the National
Assembly Chaired by Hon. Mohammed Shehu Koko. In an interview with Newsdiaryonline,
the MD of Blue Boulevard Limited, Mr. Peterking Osunde asserted that his
company has a contract of ‘Build and Transfer’ with the Nigerian Airforce
Properties Ltd ,to construct a shopping mall and market on agreement that the
property would be managed by the contractors for 20years before transfer of
ownership to the Nigerian Airforce. However, the said men of Nigerian Airforce violated the contract agreement by
invading the premises of the property. This, he said led to damages incurred by
the contractors to the tune of ₦10bn aside the loss of  means of
livelihood for over one thousand people. He further said that the case was
brought before the Federal High court in Port Harcourt where Justice Hilary
Oshomah ruled in favour of the plaintiffs but Nigerian Airforce refused to
honour the judgement to vacate the property. That prompted their need to table
the matter before the House of Representatives. On hearing the briefings, the GMD, NAF Properties Limited AVM A A Bagari said
they were not serve any  petition to appear before the House of
Representatives. This claim was countered by the leader counsel for Blue
Boulevard Limited who posited that NAF was duly served. Meanwhile, the House Committee Chairman, Hon. Koko  has ordered Blue
Boulevard Limited to serve a fresh petition to NAF HQ and NAF  Properties
Holdings on or before 27th February 2020 and a copy of the acknowledgement to
reach the committee on the 4th March, while adjourning the next sitting to 9th
March 2020
