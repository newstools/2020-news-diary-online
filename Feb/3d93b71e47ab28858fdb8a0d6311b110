The Lagos Zonal Office of the
Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has been educating parents about their
role regarding child online protection. The Zonal Office was able to
achieved this by organising a sensitisation exercise on cybersecurity and
cybercrime in order to equip parents with relevant knowledge needed to protect
themselves online while further cascading such knowledge to their children and
younger ones who use the Internet. The programme, which took place
recently at The Learning Place School, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos State, was in line
with the Commission’s regulatory mandate of protecting, informing and educating
telecom consumers in the country. Henry Ojiokpota, Controller, Lagos
Zonal Office of NCC, said the sensitisation programme was targeted at parents
of the school’s pupils, with the aim of equipping parents with the right
knowledge they require to limit the exposure of their children to the negative
aspects of Internet use. Ojiokpota, who was represented
during the sensitisation by Joseph Dimka, a Principal Manager at the Zonal
Office, said the cyber awareness programme has become  necessary given the
rising spate of criminal activities being perpetrated online. Ojiokpota said because children
listen to their parents in the area of counselling and taking parental
instructions, targeting the parents was purposive because they will, in turn,
pass the knowledge gained to train their children and guide the children’s
exposure to cyber threats as they use Internet-enabled smart devices. The team from the Zonal Office took
time to discuss and educate the parents on dimensions to cybercrimes and also
equip parents with cybersecurity measures to take, stressing the critical role
of parents in teaching the children on how to keep safe while online.
