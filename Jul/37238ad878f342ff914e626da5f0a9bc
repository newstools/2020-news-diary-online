Unknown gunmen on Tuesday killed one and abducted two family members of Salisu Usman-Maku, elder brother to Labaran Maku, a former Minister of Information. A family member, who preferred anonymity, said in Lafia that the gunmen stormed their house at Gudi village of Akwanga Local Government Area in the early hours of Tuesday. The source said the gunmen killed their sister and kidnapped their brother and his wife. It said the gunmen shot sporadically which led to the death of their sister and kidnap of their brother, who is an officer with the Nigeria Immigration Service and his wife. When contacted, Comptroller of Immigration in the state, Zainab Lawal, confirmed the incidence of the kidnap of their staff, Salihu Usman-Maku and his wife. She said: “Nigeria Immigration Officer (NIS) Supt. Salisu Usman and his wife have been abducted at gun point.” All efforts to get confirmation from the Police spokesperson in the state, ASP Ramhan Nansel, proved abortive as he did not respond to calls and text message.
