President Muhammadu Buhari has rejoiced with journalist, poet, author and sports administrator, Otunba Eddie Aderinokun at 80, July 13, 2020. The president, in a congratulatory message by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Sunday saluted the more than 60 years of vibrant journalism tucked under Aderinokun’s belt. He said this has seen him rise to editorship of the then reputable Daily Express Newspaper, and his contribution to literature through many books, particularly on poetry. “Also indelible are his footprints in sports development, particularly volleyball, where he made his mark as a very successful Chairman of the Nigerian Volleyball Federation,” he added. The president urged Aderinokun, as President of Nigeria League of Veteran Journalists, to continue sharing his wealth of experience. He also enjoined him to continue to guide younger professionals on the path of ethics and good conduct. Buhari wished Aderinokun, family, friends, the media, and sporting fraternity a joyful occasion as the milestone birthday is celebrated, and prayed for sound mind, good health, and continued service to God and mankind.
