The House of Representatives Committee on the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has gone on 30-minute break from the public hearing on alleged financial misappropriation at the Commission. Newsdiaryonline reports that the break was as a result of the acting Managing Director, Prof Daniel Pondei slumped during Reps Committee interrogation, monitored on Television Monday. The managing director, who had earlier taken oath after the Committee Chairman had recused himself from chairing the hearing, had began to speak when he suddenly slumped. The Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio was also invited by the Committee to answer some questions as a result of some allegations labelled against him by officials of the NDDC.
