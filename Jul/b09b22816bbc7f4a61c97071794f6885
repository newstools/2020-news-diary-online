  By Ibrahim Sheme Appoint me as EFCC chairman? Don’t even think about it! My reason is that all the past chairmen were hounded and or disgraced out of the office. Take a look, sir. Goodluck Jonathan said her removal was “in the interest of the nation” but insisted that he was obliged to keep the details a “state secret.” However, Mrs Waziri, in her book, ‘Farida Waziri: One Step Ahead’, says Jonathan fired her for probing oil racketeers and that she was victimised for refusing to contribute money for his election in 2011. The bottomline is that there seems to be something about that office of EFCC chairman. In Hausa, the appropriate phrase that describes it is: “kamar dai ba a gamawa lafiya a wanga ofis”. Is it jinxed? Or is it simply a question of the “Nigerian factor”? I don’t know. Nonetheless, I wish the current acting chairman, Mohammed Umar, good luck as he wades through the EFCC waves. He was a year ahead of me at the Department of Mass Communication, BUK, and he has always been a good man. I pray the Senate will confirm his appointment when the President nominates him. Above all, I pray that the next President (it is always the NEXT President!) allows him to go home in one piece, with his integrity intact and unsoiled.
