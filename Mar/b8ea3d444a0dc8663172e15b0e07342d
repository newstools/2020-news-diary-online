 Following the current impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
on the global economy coupled with efforts by the Nigerian Government,
including partial lockdown in some States and at the Federal level, to check
the spread of the virus in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has
announced to stakeholders and members of the Nigerian public that the Bank will
remain open for business during this period. A statement Wednesday said, “As a responsible public
institution and regulator, we have triggered our business continuity plans to ensure
that the Bank’s operations remain largely undisrupted at this present time when
social distancing has become key to checking further spread of the virus. We
have also directed Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and other financial institutions
to do same.” It added that “The welfare and safety of our staff and their
families, and indeed all Nigerians, remain top priority to us. Consequently,
with effect from Wednesday, March 25, 2020, till further notice, only essential
staff of the CBN Head Office and the 37 Branches of the Bank will be expected
to report for duty daily. In other words, our staff in non-critical roles have
been directed to stay at home and work remotely, when their services are
required. The apex bank added  “We
have also directed all our staff to follow stipulated guidelines by the Federal
Ministry of Health, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other
relevant health agencies of government to curb possible spread of the virus in
Nigeria. “For the avoidance of doubt, the CBN, in line with its mandate of ensuring monetary and price stability, will remain open for business during these trying times,” the statement said.
