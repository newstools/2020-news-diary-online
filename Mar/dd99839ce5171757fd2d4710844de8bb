 The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences
Commission (ICPC) has handed over N28.2 million it recovered from defaulters in
the sale of federal government houses to the Federal Capital Development
Authority (FCDA). This is in addition to over N3.8 billion the Commission had
previously recovered for FCDA since 2017 when it began tracking down
beneficiaries of the Federal Governmentâ€™s housing owner-occupier scheme for
government workers who had defaulted in their payments and those who had
outrightly refused to pay. The federal government had in 2005, introduced a policy
which allowed public servants to buy-off government houses and pay back over a
period of time. However, many of the buyers defaulted in their payments
after paying the initial sums that gave them the right of ownership of the
properties while some others completely failed to make any payments, prompting
FCDA to contact ICPC for help in recovering the monies from the defaulters. Mr. Olatunji Jabaru of Asset Tracing, Recovery and
Management Unit, ICPC, who handed over the money to the representative of FCDA,
Mrs. Omole Segun, noted that effort was on-going to recover more money from the
defaulters. The money handed over was in bank cheques of N10 million,
N8.2 million and another N10 million. In her remark after receiving the cheques, Mrs. Segun, who
represented the Director, Ad-Hoc Committee on the Sale of Government Property,
FCDA, Mr. Mohammed Umar Baffa, lauded the efforts of the Commission which had
led to the recovery of huge sums of money for the government. She added that the working relationship between ICPC and
FCDA would ensure that more defaulters were made to pay up.
