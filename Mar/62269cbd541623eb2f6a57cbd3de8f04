 The Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) has appealed Law enforcements agencies across the Country to
allow petroleum products tanker drivers free movement during the lockdown
ordered in parts of the country by President Muhammadu Buhari and some state
governments. A release today in Abuja by the NNPC
Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Dr. Kennie Obateru, said
the exemption granted by Mr. President to certain categories of essential
workers covers the operations of petroleum products tanker drivers. The release said that the Federal
Government counts on the support of the law enforcement agencies across the
country to ensure smooth distribution of petroleum products across the nook and
cranny of the country during the period of the restriction. The corporation said that NNPC holds
over 2.6billion litres of petrol enough to last the period of the lockdown and
beyond, advising that motorists should not engage in panic buying.
