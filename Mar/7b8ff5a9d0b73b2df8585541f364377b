 Ripples Nigeria and Ripples Centre for Data and Investigative
Journalism (RCDIJ), organisers of the annual Ripples Nigeria Dialogue, have
indefinitely postponed the 2020 edition of the dialogue over the coronavirus
pandemic. The 2020 dialogue was earlier slated for Thursday, April 16 at
the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Lagos. The decision to postpone the event, the organisers said, was based
on directives by state authorities to limit the number of people in a public
gathering. Prior to the directives, the organisers revealed, they had already
initiated wide consultation with public health and safety experts both within
and outside the country on how best to manage the event given the pandemic. Speaking about the postponement of the event, Editor-in-Chief of
Ripples Nigeria and Executive Director of RCDIJ, Mr Ibemere Samuel, said
“Ripples Nigeria Dialogue is usually home to hundreds of closely-interacting
participants, some widely travelled, and we knew that with the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we had a responsibility to prioritise safety over everything
else. This is exactly what we have done”. He expressed the appreciation of the organisers to all selected
speakers and intending participants for their interest and commitment during
the planning of the event. Mr Ibemere, on behalf of the organisers, also expressed “fervent
hope that this public health challenge will become history as soon
as possible”. He pledged that “Ripples Nigeria and RCDIJ will maintain their
current concerted effort towards providing enlightenment and safety information
around the virus”. Recall that in the last edition of the dialogue, Prof Wole
Soyinka led other eminent speakers like former governor of Anambra State, Peter
Obi, to discuss the theme ‘Rebuilding Trust in a Divided Nigeria’. The event
witnessed hundreds of participants.
