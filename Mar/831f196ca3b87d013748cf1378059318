 Former U.S. vice president Joe Biden
on Wednesday swept three Democratic primaries, solidifying his front-runner
status and raising doubts about the long-term viability of left-wing Senator
Bernie Sanders’ campaign.
Biden’s strong performances in Arizona, Illinois and Florida have effectively
handed him an insurmountable lead.
U.S. broadcaster CNN estimated he now has about 300 delegates more than Sanders
in the race to become the party’s candidate to face President Donald Trump in
November.
However, Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir admitted the situation was
looking bleak.
“While our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over
electability to Joe Biden. The senator will take time to assess way
forward,”Shakir said.
Running for a second time as an outside insurgent from the left, Sanders has
shifted some aspects of conversations in the Democratic Party on issues such as
health care, college fees and the minimum wage.
But Biden’s ascendency has shown a majority of Democrats are looking for a
moderate candidate from within the party establishment.
After decades as a senator, Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama.
The Democratic race is increasingly being overshadowed by the ongoing
coronavirus crisis.
Ohio is among a handful of states to have postponed its primary, which was
originally scheduled for Tuesday, March 24.(dpa/NAN)
