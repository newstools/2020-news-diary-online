 The Islamic Movement in Nigeria,IMN has said  that credible reports emanating from the Kaduna Correctional Center, where the government is “wrongly detaining” Sheikh Zakzaky and his wife has reached it  indicating a turmoil leading to the opening of fire and blocking of all access roads to the Center. IMN  Spokesman, Ibrahim Musa, who disclosed this in
a statement said “We are rightly concerned about these developments and we
strongly call on all relevant authorities to ensure that the security and 
safety of the Sheikh and his wife are guaranteed. “We would hold the federal
government responsible for any harm to them. It is the responsibility of
governments to protect all inmates in such homes, especially with the outbreak
of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world, especially as the law presumes all
to be innocent until proven otherwise by a law court.” He added, “The case of Sheikh
Zakzaky in particular, is quite different, where a federal high court had
declared his arrest and detention as unconstitutional and a violation of his
fundamental rights. Furthermore, the charges for which he is standing trial at
the moment have been punctured by two different courts, who tried nearly 200
members on the same charges and discharged and acquitted them all. “We therefore strongly demand for
the immediate release of the Sheikh and his wife,” the statement said.
