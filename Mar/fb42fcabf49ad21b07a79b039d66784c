part of the measures to cushion the effects of coronavirus. In
a statement he personally signed, the Group Managing Director, NNPC,Mele K.  Kyari said, “I n
compliance with the directives of the Honourable Minister of State for
Petroleum Resources on PMS pricing, the Corporation has reviewed its
Ex-coastal, Ex-depot and NNPC Retail pump prices accordingly. “Effective
19th March 2020, NNPC Ex-Coastal price for PMS has been
reviewed downwards from N117.6/litre to N99.44/litre while Ex-Depot price is
reduced from N133.28/litre to N113.28/litre. “These
reductions will therefore translate to N125/litre retail pump price. “Despite
the obvious cost implication of this immediate adjustment to the Corporation,
NNPC is delighted to effect this massive reduction of N20/litre for the benefit
of all Nigerians. “Accordingly,
all NNPC Retail stations nationwide have been directed to change the retail
pump price to N125/litre.”
