 The authorities at the State House,
Abuja, on Wednesday commenced screening of staff and visitors as part of
deliberate efforts to check possible spread of coronavirus. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports
that the measures adopted against the deadly virus by the State House included
introduction of hand sanitisers at strategic positions at the presidential
villa. Some staff, who spoke with NAN on
the development, lauded the management of the State House for taking such
hygiene precautions to guide against the spread of the virus. Alhaji Kabiru Yusuf urged government
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as private organisations
and establishments to emulate the State House by putting in place similar
measures to check the influx of the virus. Minister of Health, Dr Osagie
Ehanire, had on Feb. 27, confirmed the index case of COVID-19 coronavirus
disease in Lagos, Lagos State. Ehanire declared that the first
established patient was an Italian who work in Nigeria and returned from Milan,
Italy, to Lagos, Nigeria on Feb. 25, 2020. Nigeria Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC), thereafter released a public health advisory on the COVID-19 to
Nigerians, which included frequent washing ofÂ  hands with soap under
running water or use of alcohol-based sanitisers when water was not available. However, the recommendation of
sanitisers as one of the measures that could reduce the risk of COVID-19 has
brought about sudden increase in demand for the product across Nigeria.(NAN)
