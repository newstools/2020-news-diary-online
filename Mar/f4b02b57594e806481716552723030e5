 Amidst suspected plans by some
petrol marketers go create artificial scarcity under Covid-19 lockdown, Borno
Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum on Tuesday stormed some filling
stations in Maiduguri with a call on the Department of Petroleum Resources
(DPR) to seal off stations hoarding products. Zulum, in surprise outing, evaluated
quantities of fuel available at some stations he visited. The Governor’s visit
was informed by reports made to him, of some unpatriotic marketers taking
advantage of covid 19 preventive measures put in place by Government to hoard
petroleum products to exploit buyers. The Governor’s visit made some fuel
stations to revert to selling products at government fixed prices of 125 naira
pet liter as against inflated rates they forced on buyers who bought for fear
of scarcity. Zulum had during interactions with
marketers frowned at exploitative behaviors and said he would ensure they were
punished by the DPR which has the statutory duty to regulate marketers. “We will partner with DPR, the
affected stations will be appropriately sanctioned to serve as deterrent. We
noticed that most of the stations either selling above the official N125 price
per liter or hoarding the products for the reason best known to them.
Therefore, I want  to appeal to DPR that such stations be sealed” Zulum
said.
