Lesley Muosowo Otu- Abuja The National Working Committee (NWC)
of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has rebutted rumours of their being
factionalised. According to the press release from
APC secretariat made available to Newsdiaryonline, Monday,  the issues being alluded to in the media
reports are matters before the courts and should be allowed to run their normal
legal courses Spokesman of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu who signed the statement said, “In a political organisation such as the APC, contestations are not unusual and are not necessarily intractable. The exaggerated story foreboding armageddon is far-fetched. “We call on members of the
National Working Committee (NWC) and the Party’s secretariat staff to resume at
their offices and continue carrying out their scheduled roles and
responsibilities without any fear”, it reads. The statement further reads, ”
we thank the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Abubakar Adamu,
personnel of the Police, Department of State Services and other Security
Services for their professionalism in the process of maintaining the peace and
preventing hoodlums from formenting trouble at the APC National
Secretariat” In conclusion, the APC assured all
their members in Nigeria and across the world that their leaders are capable of
resolving any contestations that may arise bearing in mind the best interests
of the party and in the pursuit of progress and development of our
country.
