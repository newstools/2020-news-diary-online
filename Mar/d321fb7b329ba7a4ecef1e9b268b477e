President Muhammadu Buhari on
Tuesday expressed willingness of his administration to implement the decision
of the tripartite committee, made up of Nigeria, Benin and Niger, on the
partial closure of the country’s land border as soon as the report is received. Speaking at an audience with Mr
Bashir Mamman Ifo, outgoing President of the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and
Development (EBID) and his successor, Dr George Nana Donkor, in the State
House, President Buhari explained that the partial closure had given Nigeria a
number of insights. ‘‘We have saved millions of dollars.
We have realised that we don’t have to import rice. We have achieved food
security. ‘‘We have curtailed the importation
of drugs and proliferation of small arms which threaten our country,’’ the
President said. President Buhari thanked the
outgoing ECOWAS Bank President for the improvements recorded in his eight-year
tenure and urged his successor to build on those achievements. The outgoing bank chief informed the
President that the bank had been transformed from loss-making to profit, with
commitments from ECOWAS member-states doubling to 1.4 billion dollars. Dr Donkor, the incoming president,
thanked the Nigerian leader and its people for their support in his emergence. ‘‘Without Nigeria, I could not have
emerged,’’ he said. He gave credit to President Buhari’s
economic strategies captured under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan
(ERGP), noting that it has brought about economic recovery, stability and food
security in the country. He pledged total commitment to
partnering with Nigeria towards achieving rapid development in the country and
the rest of West Africa.
