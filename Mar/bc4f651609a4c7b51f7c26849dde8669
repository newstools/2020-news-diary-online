Given the current global outbreak of the novel
Coronavirus and its potential of causing significant disruption to health
services in the country as well as impacting negatively on the economy,
President Muhammadu Buhari has established a Presidential Task Force for the
Control of the Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19). Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity) who disclosed this in a
statement Monday said  this action is in preparation for the unlikely but
probable major outbreak of the disease in the country which will require a multi-sectoral
inter-governmental approach as advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
similar to that adopted for the HIV epidemic in the last two decades. The start and finish task group which would be
expected to deliver within a maximum period of six months, comprises the
following: a.    
Mr. Boss Mustapha (SGF) – Chair b.    
Dr. Sani Aliyu – National
Coordinator c.
