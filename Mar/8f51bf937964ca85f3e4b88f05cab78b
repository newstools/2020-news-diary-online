The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Ministerial Team on COVID-19 Restriction Enforcement on Saturday shutdown activities at a popular Pentecostal church located at Jabi District. The team, which began operations at the Wuse Market, moved to the church following complaints that the members were violating the no-gathering rule of the FCTA, and were holding weddings and other activities. The Chairman, FCT Traffic Management Task Team, Mr Ikharo Attah, who led the team, addressed the gathering and subsequently dispersed the worshippers.
