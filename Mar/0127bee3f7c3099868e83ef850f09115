 Justice A. M. Liman of the Federal High Court sitting
in Ikoyi, Lagos, on March 5, 2020, adjourned until April 24, 2020 for ruling on
the final forfeiture of two properties belonging to a former President of the
Senate, Bukola Saraki. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, is
seeking the final forfeiture of Saraki’s properties situated at 17 & 17A,
McDonald Road, Ikoyi, Eti-Osa, Lagos. Moving the application for the final forfeiture of the
properties, counsel to the applicant, Nnaemeka Omewa, told the court that the
motion, dated February 2, 2019 was supported by a 10-paragraph affidavit
deposed to by Olamide Sodiq, an investigative officer with the EFCC. “Our motion is praying this honourable court for an
order forfeiting to the Federal Government of Nigeria the properties on 17 and
17A, McDonald Road, Ikoyi, Eti-Osa, Lagos, found and recovered by the
Commission from the respondent, which is believed to have been acquired through
the proceeds of unlawful activity,” said Omewa. Omewa further told the court that the properties were
acquired with a loan obtained from Guaranty Trust Bank and paid back by money
suspected to have been diverted from the coffers of the Kwara State government. “There are also written statements from some officials
of the Kwara State government on how the money was taken from the covers of the
state government and used to pay back the loan,” he said. Omewa, therefore, urged the court to look at the merit
of the application and all the exhibits attached in granting the reliefs
sought. However, counsel to the respondent, Kehinde
Ogunwumiju, SAN, in his counter-affidavit, urged the court to reject the
application by the EFCC. Ogunwumiju further argued that the EFCC had not been
able to prove that the money used to pay back the loan was acquired by any
illegal activity. Ogunwumiju, therefore, urged the court to dismiss the
motion seeking the final forfeiture of the properties and rule in favour of the
respondent.
