 U.S. President Donald Trump says he
is considering “a quarantine of developing hot spots” in New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut. “A decision will be made, one way or
another, shortly,” Trump tweeted on Saturday. The idea did not go down well with
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York who dismissed it is unworkable. Speaking at a news conference, Cuomo
stated that he did not know how “that could be legally enforceable”. “I spoke to the president about the
ship coming up and the four sites, I didn’t speak to him about any quarantine. “I don’t even know what that means.
I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable. “From a medical point of view, I
don’t know what you would be accomplishing. I don’t even like the sound of it,”
he said. New York is currently the epicentre
of the Coronavirus epidemic in the United States with no fewer than 52,000
cases and 728 deaths. With no fewer than 100,000
infections and 1,800 fatalities, the U.S. in turn is currently the global
epicentre of the pandemic in terms of confirmed cases. (NAN)
