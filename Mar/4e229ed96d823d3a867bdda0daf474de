 Ministers
of Finance and Governors of Central Banks in Africa will converge on Transcorp
Hotel, Abuja from Monday, March 9 to Tuesday 10, 2020, for a Senior Policy
Seminar on agriculture, aimed at promulgating a policy on how the continent
would leverage research for agricultural development. The
seminar is organized by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in collaboration with
the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), a Nairobi-based public
non-profit organization, devoted to advancement of economic policy research and
training. The
seminar is expected to provide high-level African policy makers, including
Central Bank Governors, Ministers of Finance and others across the continent,
the opportunity to come together to dialogue and exchange ideas and policy
experiences and research studies conducted by the AERC and its affiliates. The
seminar, with the theme, “Agricultural and Food Policies for Better Nutrition
in Africa”, will have about 15 Central Bank Governors and Ministers of Finance
across the continent in attendance. The
AERC’s partnership with the CBN for the sponsorship of the seminar was informed
by the Bank’s effort to revamp agricultural value chains in the country in line
with the Nigeria’s agenda of reviving and diversifying the economy.
