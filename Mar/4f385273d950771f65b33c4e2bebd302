 By Lesley Muosowo Otu In line with
Government’s directives for the shutdown of crowded places as  part of
measures to curtail the spread of the dreaded coronavirus pandemic, the
National Secretariat of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has been
closed down for two weeks. Briefing the press and staff
at the secretariat, the National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole,
said the office will remain closed for two weeks. This, Oshiomhole said
was in compliance with the Federal government’s directive that people should
stay away from large congregations and social gatherings. He urged all staff and
officials of the party to remain in their various homes to look after their
immediate families and assured them that their salaries will be paid even when
they are at home. “This is just a
preventive measure the party has taken by closing down the secretariat for
about two weeks so we can manage the situation at hand; but if it persists,
then we will have to extend the holidays because we need to remain alive to be
able to serve the country as a whole and members of the party. “As APC leaders, we
must be seen to obey the federal government’s rules. It is no longer a secret
that we are facing a pandemic all over the world and Nigeria has her own share
of the coronavirus. Although, it is not as bad as other countries but clearly the
numbers are increasing. As it is said, prevention is better than cure. “We had a
conversation among ourselves at the NWC and decided to come up with this
decision to shutdown. I am not sure how many of you have private cars and some
of you use public transport to come to work which at this moment could be
dangerous. And I don’t think we will want to take any risk so we have decided
to close the office”, Oshiomole said.
