 Ecobank Nigeria
has launched a ‘StaySafeNigeria’ media campaign being part of its corporate
actions to support measures to check the rising spread of Coronavirus in
Nigeria. The integrated media campaign is a call to action, creating awareness
and educating the populace on safety measures to adopt against the dreaded
Coronavirus disease (COVID -19). Flagging off
the campaign in Lagos, Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan,
said the “StaySafeNigeria” campaign is designed to mobilise the entire
citizenry to adopt safe conduct and healthy habits to help contain the spread
of Coronavirus in Nigeria. He emphasised that with a population of about 200
million, prevention is better than cure and indeed in the case of COVID-19,
prevention is much better than “no cure”. We must therefore place top priority
on getting everyone to stop the spread or minimise the spread of the virus now,
pointing out that we cannot risk a full pandemic in Nigeria as our health
infrastructure and personnel will be easily overwhelmed if that should happen. He explained
that the messages will be in Pidgin, Ibo, Hausa, Yoruba and English on radio,
electronic and social media to take the message to the grassroots whilst
ensuring a contactless deployment in line with “StaySafeNigeria” ethos. “All hands must
be on deck to check the spread of the COVID-19. We have no choice as a caring
and responsible corporate organisation than to rise up to this challenge of our
generation and make every contribution to check the spread and save lives. Our
media campaign will engage people in very simple language on important tips to
stay safe. The campaign will be sustained to continue promoting good hygiene
conduct even after we overcome Coronavirus,” he said. Mr. Akinwuntan disclosed that the bank had engaged in many advocacy
measures to protect its staff, customers and other stakeholders since the
outbreak of the disease, stating that the bank evoked its business continuity
plans, suspended all non-essential travels, cancelled physical
meetings and resorted to virtual/digital meetings. He also emphasized strong hygiene
habits by encouraging frequent washing of hands with soap and water, provision
of alcohol based hand sanitizers in all its locations, temperature checks and
mandated employees to respect the mandatory self-isolation/quarantine for 14
days if they have been exposed in any manner. The staff of the Bank also
advised customers to maintain social distancing whilst Tellers and front office
employees attending to customers wear face masks with gloves in addition to
social distancing. It will be
recalled that Ecobank had before now, also encouraged its customers to avoid
non-essential contacts in achieving their banking needs by utilising
digital solutions to easily access their bank accounts, make contactless
payments, transfer funds and carry out other ancillary banking transactions
from the comfort of their homes and offices without visiting the branches. Some
of the digital platforms include *326#, Ecobank Mobile App, Ecobank Online,
EcobankPay, Ecobank OmniPlus, OmniLite and the Rapidtransfer App. The
StaySafeNigeria campaign is in line with the bank’s Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) which seeks to intervene and contribute to the wellbeing
of the people where it operates. Na Ecobank say
