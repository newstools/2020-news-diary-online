The Nigeria Communications
Commission (NCC) on Thursday, assured telecommunications consumers of better
services to improve their businesses. The Director, Consumer Affairs
Bureau of NCC, Alhaji Ismail Adedigba,  said this at the ongoing 41st
Kaduna International Trade Fair. The theme of this year’s fair
is:  ‘Unlocking Nigeria’s Economic Potentials through Regional
Integration.” The director said that,  “as
the regulator of telecommunications sector in Nigeria, the commission carries
out its functions to ensure service availability, accessibility, affordability
and sustainability for consumers.” He stressed the importance of the
theme of the event as,  “suitable in the current circumstances, as the
time Nigerian economy acknowledges the crucial role of telecommunications and
ICT which are key drivers of Digital Economy and enablers of our regional integration.” He noted that NCC as a National
Telecom Regulator is a consumer centric organisation, poised to developing
Consumer Protection initiatives like Complaint Channels. “We also developed the
Do-Not-Disturb Code to stop all unsolicited messages, the Mobile Number
Portability to enable changing from one service provider without changing ones’
mobile number. “The commission also developed a
comprehensive SIM replacement guidelines on June 2017 and issued
directives  to service providers  on  data Roll-Over which took
effect in June 2018.” He added that the commission issued
directives to service providers to desist from forceful or automatic renewal of
data without prior consent of subscribers. “We also monitor customer care
centres of operations across the country to ensure standard quality customer
care, availability of products and services being met and kept,” Adedigba
said.(NAN)
