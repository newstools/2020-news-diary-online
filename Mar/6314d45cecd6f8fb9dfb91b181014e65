 President Muhammadu Buhari has commended
 Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF) for
donating the handsome sum of N200 million to assist in combating the influx of
Covid-19 into the country. The President,
according to his spokesman, Femi Adesina, Wednesday  recalled that the organization had in the past
donated N1 billion to tackle Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Africa, commending
such public spiritedness to other well-to-do individuals and groups. According to
President Buhari, “Hand in hand, standing shoulder to shoulder, we can confront
our challenges as a country. This is a path for us all to follow as a people.” He used the opportunity to reiterate his earlier charge that Nigerians should take the necessary hygiene precautions, rather than panic about the Covid-19, after discovery of the index case in the country last week. The President said government, at various levels, is poised to ensure that the country and her people remain safe from the virus, which is spreading rapidly in many parts of the world.
