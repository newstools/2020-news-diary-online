All working journalists and other media staff in Lagos and Ogun
states as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have been advised to use
their valid Identity Cards to access their places of work and assignment venues
during the 14-day lockdown directed by the President in the two states and the
FCT. In a statement issued in Abuja on Monday, the Minister of
Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the clarification becomes
necessary in view of the inadequate time to properly accredit working journalists
in the affected states and the FCT during the period. He said members of the media are expected to continue to provide
essential services during the lockdown, in order to keep Nigerians well updated
on the COVID-19 pandemic.
