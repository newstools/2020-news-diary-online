provide the blend, it will have three deputy vice chancellors: DVC Academic,
DVC Administration and DVC Military. “You don’t need to be a soldier
to attend the University. This varsity is for Nigeria, no catchment area, we
will make it a unifying place”, he said. Justifying, the bill, Ndume
explained that the institution will provide civilians the knowledge of the
military, stressing that already 2,700 students have matriculated in the
institution with five faculties and 39 departments. “What the Senate is doing is to
provide the legal framework for the institution”, adding that the location
of the University in Biu was appropriate with 80 percent of the students coming
from southern Nigeria.
