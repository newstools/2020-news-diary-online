The Lagos State House of Assembly has passed a bill to establish the Lagos State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission and for connected purposes. The house passed the bill on Tuesday after the third reading and a consequent voice vote conducted by the Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa. Obasa then directed the Clerk, Mr Olalekan Onafeko, to forward a clean copy of the bill to Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu for assent. The speaker said the essence of the bill was to bring sanity and accountability to governance in the state. “With this bill, the administrative bottleneck that people usually encounter while dealing in government office, will put to an end to bribery and corruption in public office. “The bill empowers the commission with the responsibility of beaming searchlight into government’s activities. “The commission will receive petitions from people, who have any complaint, and will be able to seek redresses,” he said.
