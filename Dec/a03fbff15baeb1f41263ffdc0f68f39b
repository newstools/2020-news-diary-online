Bayelsa Gov. Douye Diri on Saturday said that he was confident that his party’s candidates in the state’s senatorial bye-elections would win the two seats. Speaking to newsmen after casting his vote at Sampou, his country home, the governor expressed confidence that his candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were going to win the elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Bayelsa bye-elections took place in the Bayelsa Central and West senatorial districts, vacated by him and the Deputy Governor. Diri said: “The candidates of PDP are uncomparable. We fielded quality candidates and you can see the difference between the PDP candidates and particularly the other candidates. I don’t want to mention the names. “The Senate is not a place for jokers or people who were dismissed from the service. “The Senate is for those with integrity and for those who can comprehend. “It is for those who can bring an argument on the floor that can convince their colleagues and I think the candidates of PDP have all that. He explained that the process of the election was very easy and faster maintaining that the card reader identified him. “I can describe the process as being smooth and peaceful. The acreditation and voting enhanced the process instead of waiting for hours,” he said. He, however, pleaded with Bayelsa people not to give the state a negative image stating that “Our state is not a state of armed robbers. “It is not a state of destroyers or a state of false people. It is not a state of thuggery. We work hard to earn a living. “It is a state of integrity. I want to call on all our youths and women to conduct themselves in a manner that will bring positive image to Bayelsa state,” he added. (NAN)
