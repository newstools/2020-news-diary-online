The Kano State Agricultural and Rural Development Agency (KNARDA) has urged Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA) to support the state towards the training of extension workers and provision of mini farming implements to encourage agricultural productivity. KNARDA Managing Director, Alhaji Ibrahim Dan-Isle, made the call when the Deputy Country Director of SAA, Dr Abdulhamid Gambo, paid him a courtesy visit on Monday in Kano. Dan-Isle said the call was imperative to enhance training of extension workers, and farmer access to farm tools as well as develop their enterprising skills. According to him, Kano State has the highest number of extension workers in the country, adding that it needs support of SAA to build their capacities. The managing director noted that entrepreneurial development programmes would build farmers enterprising skills, encourage processing, value addition and provide market for the produce.       “Sasakawa Africa Association is providing intervention in the areas of wheat, rice, maize, tomato, vegetable and livestock productions in the state in the past two decades. “It has done well in its programmes through introduction of modern farming techniques, provision of improved seedlings, preservation and processing technologies in the state. “This has increased yields per hectare, and herald major shift from subsistent to commercial farming.         “We commend SAA for its support and ask for more intervention in training of extension workers and provision of small and medium farming implements,” he said. In a remark, Gambo, said the visit was part of a Media Field Day to appraise the activities of the programme in the 18 participating states during the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
