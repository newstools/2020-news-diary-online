The National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) in Adamawa trained 80 people in different indigenous languages from January to November. NICO Director in Adamawa, Mrs Jane Anigala, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Yola that the institute has the mandate of orienting Nigerians on cultural values. She said that institute also has the mandate to sensitise people to shun harmful cultural practices and embrace those that would promote the image of Nigeria.        “For now, we have four languages; Fulfulde, Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo and we were able to train 80 people, for free because it’s part of our mandate. “Some of our languages are going into extinction and we want to encourage people to come and learn them. “We were not able to train more people due to COVID-19 challenge and currently the training is still ongoing at the military barracks apart from the weekend programme,’’ she said. Anigala encouraged parents to also bring their children and wards during the long vacation to learn more indigenous languages at an early age. (NAN)
