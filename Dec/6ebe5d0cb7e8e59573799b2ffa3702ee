The Federal Government is to revive three major power projects in Abia North Senatorial District, in the first quarter of 2021, according to the Minister of Pow Mamman, who stated this in a statement issued on Saturday in Abuja by his Senior Special Adviser, Media and Communication, Mr Aaron Artimas, identified the projects to include: the 60/40MVA Ampree substation, 132 KVA Ampree transmission lines, located in Arochukwu, Ohafia and Ubur-Ihechiowa, and whose contracts were awarded in 2001. The minister, who expressed disbelief that the projects, which were 95 per cent completed, were abandoned for over 10 years, pledged that the contracts would be reviewed and re-awarded for immediate completion. “The power projects are of immense benefit to the people, because they will not only boost their electricity supply, but also give room for expansion to cover the entire Abia Senatorial districts,” Mamman said. The minister, who was accompanied on the inspection visit by Sen. Orji Uzo Kalu of Abia North, addressed cheering crowds at the three locations and assured them that their long wait was over.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sen. Kalu and other leaders of the host communities, expressed their appreciation for the minister’s visit. (NAN)
