The Executive Secretary of NALDA, Mr Paul Ikonne made this known in press statement issued on Monday in Abuja adding that the partnership was to achieve food security for the country.  Ikonne said the authority would engage 400 youths under it National Young Farmers Scheme in collaboration with FCHD in the dry season farming.           According to him, the agency had commenced the reactivation of its 300 hectares of farmland in the state.
