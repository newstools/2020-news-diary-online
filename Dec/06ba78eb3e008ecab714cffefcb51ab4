Organisers of the Edo 2020 trade fair say no fewer than 45 exhibitors have registered ahead of the Dec. 14 opening, Director of the Edo 2020 Trade Fair Planning Committee, Mr Osayande Igbe, disclosed in Benin on Tuesday. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Igbe said that whilst the fair will officially open to the public on Dec. 14, registration of exhibitors and Road Shows kicked off on Dec. 4. “We started the fair with registration of exhibitors, because we want participants to know the different categories of exhibitors that will be on ground. The registration is still ongoing, while the list of registered exhibitors will be published on the trade fair website for enquiries”, the director said.         He said the road shows, which started days before the commencement of the fair, would be sustained throughout the fair as a means of creating continued awareness, adding that exhibitors and participants are assured of adequate security, and discounted products and services during the fair. “Goods and services would be available at affordable prices, so we are urging Edo residents to come and shop for the Christmas and New Year Day celebrations. “The fair will also offer opportunities for Small and Medium scale businesses to partner with bigger firms and expand their businesses”, he added.
