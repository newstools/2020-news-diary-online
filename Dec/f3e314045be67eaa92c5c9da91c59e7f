The Nigerians in Diaspora Organisations (NIDO Worldwide) have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to rejig the nation’s security architecture in order to bring an end to insurgency and banditry in parts of the country. NIDO Worldwide, in a statement on Monday, condemned the killings of farmers and fishermen in Jere and Zabarmari areas of Borno during a recent Boko Haram attack. The statement was jointly signed by E. C. Ejiogu, Bashir Obasekola, Obed Monago, Gary Unamadu and Obinna Kingsman, Chairmen of NIDO in Asia, Europe, Americas, Oceania and Africa, respectively.           “We condemn in strong terms this barbaric act of these terrorists, who have decided to demonstratively attack and behead unarmed civilian farmers, cause fear and pandemonium and thereby undermining the food security and wellbeing of Nigerians,” NIDO Worldwide said. The organisations commiserated with the families and friends of the recent victims of insecurity in the country. “Our prayers and thoughts are indeed with all our compatriots in Nigeria, who are daily facing this unpleasant situation. May the souls of the victims rest in perfect peace,” the NIDO said. (NAN)
