The management of Pope John Paul II Old People’s Home in Calabar has appealed to well-meaning Nigerians and corporate organisations to assist it purchase adult diapers for some inmates in the home.
Senior Welfare Officer of the home, Yvonne Maria, made the appeal when the Christ Universal Mercy Fellowship visited the home on Monday.
Maria said that lack of diapers, especially for elderly inmates with one ailment or the other, had become an embarrassment and a cause of concern to the home.       She said that the home had about 30 elderly people, with few children who are orphans and must be catered for.
According to her, the home will appreciate donations of food stuff, but most importantly, adult diapers.
“About seven or more of the elderly here must wear diapers every day without which everywhere is messed up.
“So, we appeal to public spirited persons and groups to help us by donating diapers more, and food stuff of course,” she said.       Responding, Mrs Ronke Aluko, President of Christ Universal Mercy Fellowship, said the group had to reach out to the less privileged in the society, which was why it came to the home.
“We are here to identify with our fathers and mothers, who are the senior citizens of this nation to let them know that we have them in mind.
“As a group, we will continue to carry out humanitarian work which is what God desires; also, the situation here should remind us all to think about our tomorrow,” she said.
The group used the opportunity to donate food items and adult diapers to the home. (NAN)
