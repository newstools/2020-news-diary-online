Some commercial motorcyclists and tricycle operators were seen operating freely in some parts of Ikorodu in spite of the restriction on movement during Saturday’s Lagos-East by-elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Lagos State Police Command had on Dec.4, announced restriction of movement in Somolu, Kosofe, Epe, Ikorodu, and Ibeju-Lekki Local Government Areas for the Lagos-East by-elections. The police said that the restriction, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m, however, exempted essential workers and students writing West Africa School Certificate Examinations (WASCE). NAN, however, reports that commercial vehicles were seen picking passengers and stranded passengers in various parts of Ikorodu. A visit to Ota/Ona and Ikorodu Roundabout showed that there were no mounted road blocks by security personnel, which was the usual practise during elections in Ikorodu. Commuters were seen waiting for vehicles at the garage, with few motorcyclists picking passengers to Agric, Ebute, Erunwen, Itamaga, Sabo, among other locations, while the polls lasted. Private car owners were seen moving freely within the town, while some pedestrians were seen walking to their polling centres and others heading to various locations. Mr Tunde Biyi, a commercial motorcyclist, said that 100 per cent compliance to restriction of movement wasn’t possible. “People will need to move around whether to their polling centres or other locations, we are here to make it easy for them,” he said. Food vendors were also seen hawking beans, bread, while some shops within streets opened to conduct their usual business activities. The ambiance within Ikorodu during the poll was generally peaceful, with many residents indoor, while security personnel ensured the smooth conduct of the election. (NAN)
