The House of Representatives recently asked the President to appear and brief members on the security situation. It could be recalled that though the Senate did not call on the president to appear before the upper legislative chamber, Senators recently reiteratedÂ  their call on the president to sack the service Chiefs. These renewed calls came on the heels of the massacre of over 43 rice farmers at Zabarmari by Boko Haram in Borno, northeast ofÂ  Nigeria. Submit
