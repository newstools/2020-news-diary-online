These circumstances may expose them to dangerous health risks and even death while saving other lives. “We, in the NMA, have opened another chapter of warmer relationship based on mutual respect and acknowledgement of our different but inter-dependent roles in the health sector. “We pledge to continue on this path for better patient outcomes and the good of our country, Nigeria,” he stated. He noted with particular concern hazards all healthcare professionals, including nurses working at the frontlines of the war against COVID-19 face continually. “It is our prayer that those in authority will do all it takes to ensure a healthy working environment that is ennobling and dignifying,” he stressed.
