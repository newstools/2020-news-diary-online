Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Thursday urged leaders of Shasha Market in Akure to limit the crowds in the market due to the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. Akeredolu made the call in Akure during an unscheduled visit to the market. He expressed concern for the large crowd in the market in spite of the order on social distancing and dusk to dawn curfew in the state to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic. The governor gave an example of Kano where the pandemic had claimed so many lives due to non compliance with social distancing. According to Akeredolu, the Shahsha Market will now have two days on, and two days off with effect from Friday. “They have been given the grace to sell their commodities till Friday. No market on Saturday and Sunday, but the market will open on Monday and Tuesday. “There are too many people here. People come in here and it’s so full because everybody is clustered together,” he said. He directed the presence of police personnel in the market to enforce the social distancing order. Earlier, Undie Adie, Commissioner of Police, Ondo State Command, said his officers would be deployed to partner with the leaders, and to ensure that all rules concerning social distancing and operations of the market were strictly adhered to. Also, Shehu Ibrahim, the Seriki of Shahsha Market, thanked Akeredolu for the grace to sell their commodities between now and Friday. He also directed henceforth that the market would operate two days on, and two days off, and warned market women and traders to ensure strict compliance with the new rules. (NAN)
