 President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled
with the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, over the death of
his father, Alhaji Idris Hussain. Reacting to the sad news, the President said the late Hussain “did not
only live for himself, but also devoted his life to the service of humanity
through his philanthropic deeds.” According
to President Buhari, “his selflessness and passion for humanity are
virtues for which he will be remembered for many years to come.” The
President appealed to other well-to-do members of society “to borrow a
leaf from the noble deeds of the late Idris Hussain.” He
prayed Allah to forgive the soul of the deceased and grant him paradise “for
his good deeds during his remarkable life on earth.”
