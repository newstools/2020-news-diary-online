 By Lesley Muosowo Otu The Nigerian Union of Journalists
(NUJ) National Secretariat  has  frowned at the decision of the Federal
Government to bring in Chinese Medical doctors to Nigeria in the fight against
Covid -19 pandemic. This was contained in a media
release jointly signed by the National President of Nigerian Union of
Journalists, Mr. Chris Isiguzo and its National Secretary, Mr. Shuaibu Usman
Leman on Saturday 4, April 2020 and made available to Newsdiaryonline. NUJ  stated that despite Nigerian doctors doing
exceptionally well in fighting the outbreak, the Federal Government still went
ahead to invite the Chinese Medical Mission “We caution that it will be
counter productive to bring in Chinese doctors. While some  have applauded
the way and manner China contained the virus in Wuhan- the only Chinese city to
be so affected, we hasten to note that there is more to this charade than is
being let out by the Chinese authorities, and we  reject a situation where
Nigeria will be used as a Guinea pig for any experiment. “It is pertinent to plead with
the Federal Government to  stop this Medical team from coming to Nigeria
because of  the Italian example where there was an inexplicable spike in
Covid 19 related deaths when the Chinese doctors arrived the country. “The FG should as a matter of
urgent concern investigate the allegation that what is happening today is
associated with the launching of the 5G communication network,  as
Nigerians are becoming more agitated over the issue which cannot be swept under
the carpet. “We urge the FG to be more
proactive in dealing with these emerging issues because any mistake made will
be catastrophic”, the statement reads.
