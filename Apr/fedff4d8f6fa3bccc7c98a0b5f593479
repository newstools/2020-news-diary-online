 Minister of Transportation, Rt Hon.
Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, has condoled with President, Muhammadu Buhari and the
Kyari family on the passing of the Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba
Kyari. Amaechi described Abba Kyari as a
seasoned and remarkable administrator who took his job seriously and
contributed immensely to the success of President Buhari as his Chief of Staff. “Today, I join Nigerians, members of
cabinet and staff of the presidency to mourn late Abba Kyari and pray for the
repose of his soul. I also pray that his wife, Mrs. Kulu Abba Kyari, his family
and loved ones find strength in this very trying time to bear this heavy loss,”
he said. Amaechi also urged Nigerians to take
the coronavirus pandemic seriously and follow strictly all health safety
protocols. “As we have unfortunately
experienced, the virus is no respecter of persons. Please adhere to the laid
down health advisory, obey the restrictions and safety rules, so that together
we can win this war, save more lives and come out stronger at the end of it
all,” Amaechi said.
