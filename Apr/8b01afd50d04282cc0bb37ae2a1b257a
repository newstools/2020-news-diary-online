 Borno Governor, Babagana Umara
Zulum, early today, returned to the extended family residence of late Malam
Abba Kyari for combined third and seventh day post-funeral prayers. Zulum had
visited the family on Sunday. Late Kyari’s royal family decided to
combine prayers for third and seventh days so that mourners do not have to
return in view of the need for social distancing. The Shehu of Bama, His Highness,
Kyari Ibn Umar Elkanemi, led the family in taking the decision. Chief Imam of
Borno, Imam Zannah Laisu, moderated clerics and mourners during the prayers
that took place at the residence of the deceased’s younger brother, Baba-Shehu
Zannah Arjinoma, who is the district head of Banki town in Bama Local
Government Area. Governor Zulum, was accompanied by
the Senator representing Southern Borno, Sen. Mohammed Ali Ndume, state
chairman of the APC, Ali Bukar Dalori, Secretary to Borno State Government,
Chief of staff and some commissioners. Late Abba Kyari who was President
Muhammadu Buhari’s chief of staff, died of corona virus last Friday in Lagos
and was buried in Abuja on Saturday.
