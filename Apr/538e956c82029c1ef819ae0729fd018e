 The
global oil market continues to suffer from the vagaries of the corona virus
pandemic, as prices continue to crash due to the sudden, massive and unexpected
drop in worldwide demand for crude oil. The
features market for commodities is a turbulent one, due to unforeseen hazards
that come and go. Today, it is COVID19; tomorrow, it will be something else. It is
time for Nigeria to protect her economy from being tossed to and fro by
circumstances beyond our control. We must assert our sovereignty, by exerting
more influence over the global trade in crude oil, and other features. I
believe that the time is right for Nigeria to build a strategic crude oil
reserve, with massive storage capacity that can hold at least a month’s worth
of our OPEC production capacity. If we
build such an infrastructure, we will not have to sell our crude at a
production loss. We will be in a position to stockpile the product in our
reserve until such a time as prices improve. Indeed,
other nations take such measures to protect their economy. North American and
European nations have such internal controls to protect almost every sector of
their economy – from agriculture, automobile, and even intellectual property.
Nigeria cannot be left behind. We must be in business for the best interest of
our economy. I would
also strongly recommend that we discuss with our partners in the Organisation
of Petrol Exporting Countries, and obtain a concession, whereby we can defer
our daily quota, such that when we undersell, due to a crash in the price of
crude oil, we can oversell when the prices stabilize, subject to the condition
that we balance out our quota. Nigeria’s
oil industry remains more susceptible to outside influences, than to internal
control. This measure can flip that, and make our oil industry more stable,
even when there is global instability. This will translate to greater economic
independence on our part. Atiku
