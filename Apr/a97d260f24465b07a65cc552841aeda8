On 31 March 2020,
the Management of FIRS had a virtual meeting, following the Federal
Government’s lockdown of FCT, Lagos, and Ogun States on 29th March
2020 as one of the measures to contain the spread of Corona Virus, COVID – 19. We
discussed specifically the necessity of FIRS  to remain
committed to supporting the Taxpayers to continue to thrive even when faced with the
pressure of generating increased tax revenue for the Government. Throughout the days
and months ahead, we want to reassure you that supporting Nigeria’s diverse and
dynamic businesses through this uncertain time is our topmost priority. The response to the current situation is evolving rapidly, with advice and
guidance changing daily. In the meantime, FIRS has setup a number of measures
to provide support to TaxPayers in managing their tax obligationsas they are
impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. These are: I commend the businesses that have made commitments, some of which have
been followed through with payments. I thank you for your demonstration of uncommon patriotism. My team and I are committed to, as a priority, providing support to all Taxpayers as directed by President Muhammadu
Buhari in his lockdown speech of Sunday 29th March 2020. We will keep you updated with information specific to Taxpayers
as it becomes expedient andon how the Service can continue
to support you while we maintainessential services
in these trying times. For further advice please contact asheikh.maidugu@firs.gov.ng Muhammadu Nami Executive Chairman
