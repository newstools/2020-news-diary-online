 International Human Rights and Accountability
groups (The Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre),
Cornerhouse, GlobalWitness and Re:common) have in joint petitions called the
attention of the French Consulate in Nigeria, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
and the Director General, Federal Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission (FCCPC) to the reported attempt by French medical experts to test
COVID-19 vaccines in Africa on Africans and the claim that antiretroviral drugs
have been previously tested on the continent. The groups urged the Ministry,
agency and Consulate to urgently investigate the matter, make public the
findings of their investigations, bring culprits to justice, halt any such
process that may be in action and protect Nigerians in particular and Africans
in general from being used as vaccines testing rats. In a statement issued in Lagos by HEDA’s
Chairman, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, amid the State’s lockdown to curb the spread of
the COVID-19 pandemic, HEDA said it was also requesting under the Freedom of
Information (FOI) Act, 2011, information from the National Agency for Food and
Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to determine whether antiretroviral
drugs were truly tested in Nigeria by French Doctors or pharmaceutical
companies by obtaining details of HIV/AIDS drugs and or vaccines manufactured
by any French firm and which were certified by NAFDAC for trial and testing in
Nigeria from January 2002 to December 2004. According to the statement, “In a recent development
widely circulated by international media outlets, particularly Aljazeera in a
publication of April 4, 2020 titled: “Racism row as French doctors
suggest virus vaccine test in Africa” and which was also circulated on
Twitter, two French doctors (Jean-Paul Mira and Camille Locht) who were
interviewed on a French Television Channel, LCI, indicated the tendency of
testing the BCG tuberculosis vaccine in Africa on Africans to discover if the
vaccine can be used to treat COVID-19. More saddening, the interview also
indicated that the practice of using Africans as rats or guinea pigs to test
vaccines is not new to the French. “During the interview, Jean-Paul Mira, head of
the Intensive Care unit at the Cochin Hospital in Paris, said: “It
may be provocative. Should we not do this study in Africa where there are no
masks, no treatment or intensive care, a little bit like it’s
been done for certain AIDS studies, where among prostitutes,
we try things, because we know that they are highly exposed and don’t protect
themselves?”. In the same breath, Camille Locht, Research Director at
France’s National Health Institute, Inserm, agreed, saying: “You are
right. And by the way, we are thinking in parallel about a study in Africa
using this same approach.”” According to the letter to the Honourable
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoffrey Onyeama, HEDA said: considering that
Nigeria would have been the biggest victim of any such attempt in the past and
likely in the future, given its stature as the most populous African country,
it urged the ministry to “urgently, as a matter of statutory responsibility
investigate any past activity of testing antiretroviral drugs in Nigeria; make
public findings from the investigations; collaborate with other relevant MDAs
to prosecute the offenders; immediately halt any real or potential medical
collaboration with the French; in particular investigate the extent of
activities that have been carried out by the French authorities to test the
COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria with an official demand for explanation/information
from the relevant French agencies and to collaborate with all relevant
government agencies to take all necessary steps to protect Nigerians from being
used as testing rats for the proposed COVID-19 vaccine.” The organisation also referenced their letter to
the Director General of the FCCPC, Mr Babatunde Irukera, where it urged the
Commission “to take immediate action to investigate any case of testing
antiretroviral drugs on Nigerians in the past or present and bring the offenders
to book; frontally address this looming danger to ensure that a mistake is not
made to reduce innocent citizens to guinea pigs susceptible to French medical
experiments and, to protect the right of Nigerians not to be subjected to such
treatment as contained in Section 42 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria (as
amended) and Statutes setting up the Commission.” In the same vein, HEDA said it also tasked Mrs.
Laurence Monmayrant, Consul General of the French Consulate to Nigeria to
immediately “initiate investigation into the claim by the above-mentioned
French medical professionals that Africans were used to test HIV/AIDS vaccine
and advise the French government for appropriate action against those who were
complicit in the inhuman act of the antiretrioviral drug test; immediately stop
any attempt to test BCG tuberculosis vaccine or any COVID-19 vaccine in Africa
on Africans; and publicly apologise to Africans on the racist comment of the
two French medical experts.” According to Mr Suraju, Indeed, statistics as at
April 5, 2020 reveals that Europe alone has recorded over 46,000 deaths with
the highest number coming from Spain and Italy, while France records over 8,000
deaths as a result of the COVID-19. So far, Africa is the least affected
continent with 7,500 cases and 320 deaths. While the deaths are regrettable, he
said, the figures show that France and Europe generally are more in need of the
vaccine for COVID-19. Therefore, he added, “we urge that whatever vaccine
developed or is being developed should be tested in Europe and on Europeans
before extending the benevolence to Africa.” He said: “Africans, particularly Nigerians, are
already overburdened with the untoward hardship being faced due to the COVID-19
pandemic, such discriminatory comments or in fact any attempt to use Africa as
a testing lab would only add salt to the injury. Indeed, the Director General
of the World Health Oganisation has decried this affront by the French agencies
and declared the statements by the French doctors as racist.” HEDA cautioned that if it were to be established
that such experiments have in fact been undertaken, with inadequate or limited
free, prior and informed consent, then such would constitute a case of serious
medical malpractice, and place the practitioners in breach of the
post-Nuremberg code on “Permissible Medical Experiment” – a situation that
would be completely untenable and beyond excuse.
