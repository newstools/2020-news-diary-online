 The Kaduna State State Committee on Covid-19 has announced that markets will partially open on Tuesday, 14th April, and Wednesday, 15th April 2020 from 8am to 6pm on each day. Only sellers of food and medicines are permitted to open their shops. This is part of the deliberate policy of relaxing the restriction of movement on two days every week to enable citizens stock up on food and essentials. Customers who come into the market are expected to observe social distancing which will be strictly enforced. Commercial buses are expected to comply with the limit of two persons per row maximum. Okadas and Keke Napeps are prohibited from plying any road. Only persons who have a compelling reason to go out should do. The public health advisory is that Covid-19 prevention requires people to stay at home, wash their hands regularly with soap and water, avoid large gatherings and observe respiratory hygiene. The danger of community transmission is high, and the health system cannot cope with a wide outbreak. Let us join hands to protect each other.
