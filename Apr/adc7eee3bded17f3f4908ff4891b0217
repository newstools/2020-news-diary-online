 In the light of the presidential directive, during the nationwide broadcast last night, it is essential that attention be drawn to the reported large number of food trucks that are being delayed at various checkpoints around the country or prevented from crossing state borders, as a result of the various curfews and lockdowns in different states, the Presidency said in a statement Tuesday. According to a statement signed by Mallam Garba Shehu, Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President  (Media & Publicity),  the restrictions of movement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic do not apply to vehicles transporting essential commodities, such as food. The Presidency said, “The country cannot afford a situation where agricultural products are being left to rot in trucks held at various checkpoints, when millions of Nigerians across the country need food. COVID-19 or no COVID-19, Nigerians need to eat.” Other essential items that can be transported despite the ban on movement as prescribed by the Presidential Task Force (PTF)  according to the Presidency, include: pharmaceutical and sanitary supplies, personal care items, agro chemicals and agricultural machinery, electrical products and electronics, oil and gas, courier services, health supplies and protective garments. Vehicles transporting essential items must not convey any commercial passengers. In addition, the occupants must not exceed three, i.e. the driver, spare driver, and conductor, Shehu said. “The drivers must have basic protective and sanitary items, including: face masks, hand sanitisers, and tissue paper to and from their destinations. Once these conditions are satisfied, they must be allowed to travel freely to and from any part of Nigeria,” the statement said.
