 After three years of
struggling with diabetes, one of President Muhammadu Buhari’s bodyguards,
Warrant Officer Lawal Mato, on Tuesday passed away. According
to a statement signed by Malam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the
President (Media
& Publicity) the
President described the officer, who had been working with him for many years
before he won the 2015 elections, as “very thorough, trustworthy and dependable
soldier who carried out his duty with diligence and focus.’’ President Buhari prayed
that Allah will ease his passage to paradise and grant his family, government
and people of Jigawa State, the fortitude to bear the loss. WO Mato was part of a team
that former President Umaru Musa Yar’adua restored to President Buhari as
personal security and he had been off full duty for three years, treating
diabetes.
