 Governor Nasir El Rufai of Kaduna
State has congratulated the Christian  community on the completion of
Lent, with its attendant disciplines of fasting, prayers and charity. In an Easter message signed by Mr
Muyiwa Adekeye, the Special Adviser on Media and Communications on Saturday, El
Rufai felicitated with the Christian community on the special occasion of
Easter. The governor pointed 
out  that the enduring message of Easter   which is   
victory over darkness, ‘’is poignant amidst the uniquely difficult
circumstances in which Easter is being celebrated  this year.’’ The governor noted that 
the uniquely difficult circumstances the COVID-19 pandemic has created, 
has also impacted on formal acts of worship to celebrate Easter. ‘’The closure of churches due to
quarantine conditions in many places across the world, makes it impossible to
celebrate Easter in the traditional way; a most unusual development,’’ he said. El Rufai  urged the
Christian community ‘’to keep hope alive even in these dire moments,’’ adding
that ‘’with careful attention to preventive measures, humanity will rise above
the devastations and disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic.’’ “Just as the pains and humiliation
of the Crucifixion ended in the triumph of the resurrection, today’s
difficulties shall provide renewal, a chance to give thanks anew to Almighty
God, ‘’ the governor assured. El-Rufai who appealed to all
communities in Kaduna State to uphold peace and harmony, urged  all
residents to observe social distance, practice regular hand washing with soap
and water and avoid large gatherings to protect everyone from COVID-19. The statement also  appealed to
citizens of Kaduna State  to  comply with the terms of the quarantine
imposed on the state.
