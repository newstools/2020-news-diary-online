Minister of State, Mines & Steel
Development, Dr. Uchechukwu Sampson Ogah, has felicitated with Christian
faithful in Nigeria and the people of Abia stae, as they celebrate the
resurrection of Jesus Christ. In a goodwill message he sent out on
Saturday, Dr. Ogah also prayed for God’s special intervention to enable Nigeria
overcome the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has so far claimed
thousands of lives across the globe. He reminded Abians and Nigerians in
general that Easter was “a time of thanksgiving to God for not sparing His only
begotten son, Jesus Christ, who died for our sins,” just as the period also
afforded Christian faithful an opportunity to “reflect on the benefits of the
death and resurrection of our Lord, Jesus Christ.” “The Bible chronicles that, among
other things, the death of Christ on the cross redeemed mankind from sin: 
tale of unmatched love of God for us and gateway to eternal life. At Easter,
therefore, our common victory song is triumph of eternal life over death,” the
Minister said. “We should therefore, sing victory
songs because Christ has conquered for us which makes us beneficiaries of His
Love, Mercy and Grace,” he added. He observed that the global crisis
caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic might have attenuated our songs of
gladness, disrupted and dislocated humanity, exacerbated inconveniences and
hardship and engendered a moment of fear and despair as well. Still, Dr. Ogah encouraged all
Nigerians to be “resolute in faith, ceaseless in courage and boundless in love
for God and humanity,” assuring that the challenges of this present time
“cannot prevail over the gains of the resurrection of Christ and of His love
for us.” The Minister said he was “evermore
convinced that, according to Romans 8: 35, nothing can separate us from the
love of Christ” -National Accord
