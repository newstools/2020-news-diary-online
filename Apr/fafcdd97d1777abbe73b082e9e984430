 After just over a month, the
repatriation programmes of various European governments and numerous tourism
providers due to the coronavirus crisis, have almost been fully completed, the
German Lufthansa Group announced on Friday. According to Lufthansa, the
coronavirus pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions have triggered a
return of an “unprecedented” number of holidaymakers and travellers since
mid-March. Lufthansa Group airlines have
repatriated around 90,000 people. A total of 437 special flights had
taken off from 106 airports worldwide with a destination in Europe, according
to Germany’s largest airline. Eleven more such special flights are
set to follow in the coming days. Lufthansa’s last repatriation flight
is expected to arrive in Frankfurt next Monday, the company said. To help supply agricultural
businesses in Germany with seasonal workers, Lufthansa subsidiary Eurowings has
also carried out 27 so-called “harvest helper flights” with around 2,500
passengers, the company said. The Lufthansa Group also operated 94
special cargo flights carrying relief supplies, such as protective equipment
and face masks, the release said. (Xinhua/NAN)
