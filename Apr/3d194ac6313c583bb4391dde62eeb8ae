 The Police in Zamfara have raided a
Kwali mining site in Bukkuyum Local Government Area where foreigners were
carrying out illegal mining activities. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reports that the state Commissioner of Police, Usman Nagogo, led the team of
security agents to the mining sites on Monday. Nagogo said the measure was in line with
the Federal Government’s directives banning all mining activities across the
country. “You know, the federal government
has given the mandate to the security agents to enforce the order. “This followed an intelligence
report that illegal miners were still operating at the site despite several
warnings by the command,’’ the commissioner said. Nagogo said two labourers, Hamisu
Umar and Dahiru Mohammed, were arrested at the site, while others escaped into
the forest. “One of the suspects, Hamisu Umar,
confirmed the presence of foreign nationals such as Chinese, Koreans and
Burkinabes working in collaboration with Nigerians but they were not met during
the raid. “The suspects are assisting the
police with vital information that could lead to arrest of their
leaders,’’ he said. According to the commissioner, some
of the tools used for the illegal mining were recovered as exhibits. He said a combined team of
Police Mobile and Counter Terrorism Unit had been deployed to take
over the site to forestall further illegal mining activities. He called on the public to obey
government directives as anybody who goes against the laws of the land would be
dealt with squarely. (NAN)
