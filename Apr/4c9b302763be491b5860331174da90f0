 Persons who fail to comply with the
restriction of movement and other prohibition order imposed by the Niger State
Government shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment or both in accordance with
the extant laws. Disclosing this at a Media briefing,
Secretary to the State Government, SSG and Chairman State Action Committe on
COVID-19, Ahmed Ibrahim Matane said the new measure became necessary following
the gross disrespect for the appeals and directives on social distancing and
social gatherings by the people as the only precautionary measures against the
spread of Coronavirus. According to the Committee Chairman,
it became imperative to go beyond appeals and directives to contain the spread
of the highly infectious disease in order to avoid an impending health and
economic calamity of unimaginable proportion in the State. Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane said the
Governor decided to invoke the Niger State COVID-19 Order 2020, conferred on
him by all the relevant portions of the law and the Constitution for the
collective good, safety, security and public health of the people. According to the SSG, the State
Government has relaxed the restriction of movement imposed in the State from
2:00pm to 10.00pm beginning from Sunday, 5th April, 2020. Markets are now to open from 8:00am
to 2:00pm to enable people buy food stuff and other essentials while the intra
and inter State movement of people and vehicles remain banned. He announced that the State Civil
Servants on Grade Level 1 – 12, earlier directed to stay at home as part of
measures to curb the spread of the disease, are now to resume work on Monday,
6th April, 2020, from 8.00am to 2.00pm. Meanwhile, all Local Government
Areas sharing border with neighbouring States have been directed to ensure
effective monitoring of people and vehicles coming into the local government as
all entry points to the State remain closed except those on essential services. While debunking insinuations going
round that the State government has banned ‘call to Prayers’, the Secretary to
the State Government advised the people to shun rumour mongering, adding that
the State is yet to record any case of COVID-19.
