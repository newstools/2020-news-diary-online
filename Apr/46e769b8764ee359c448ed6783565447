 The Youths Digest, in collaboration
with the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) plans a training programme for
young journalists on digital security on Twitter. This is coming as Nigeria and other
countries of the world continue to battle Coronavirus. The tweet chat, which will take
place concurrently on the online newspaper and CPJ’s Twitter pages–
@youthsdigest and @CPJAfrica–will be anchored by CPJ’s Senior Africa Program
Researcher, Jonathan Rozen. Youths Digest, in a tweet on its
Twitter page, said the training is a ‘safety advisory session on digital
security issues’ for journalists and media outlets who still need to work
during the coronavirus outbreak. “Journalists who are reporting
on the spread of COVID-19 are at risk of being exposed to malware and scams, as
criminals target people with misinformation and sophisticated phishing
campaigns linked to the virus. “These are more of a threat to
journalists working without tech support, or using personal devices that have
not been secured; personal information could also be at risk if devices in the
home are exposed to malware,” the tweet reads. The online conversation will be the
first of the four series expected to train campus writers and journalists. Meanwhile, Nigeria and other
countries around the world have been shut down, as efforts are being
intensified to contain the global pandemic. Nigeria has reported over 200 cases
with most journalists made to work from home. Youths Digest, the organizer of the
annual Campus Journalism Awards (CJA) and Campus Journalism Dialogue (CJD), is
also the publisher of News Digest, an online newspaper. On the other hand, CPJ which is
popularly known as Journalism Red Cross is an American based non-profit
organisation that promotes press freedom and defends the rights of journalists. The online training is supported by
the Civil Society and Legislative Advocacy Center (CISLAC).
