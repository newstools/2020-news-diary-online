According to him, these deliberate steps have seen the NPL ratio of the company’s vintage book remain below 1 per cent. “In the same vein, we have made significant improvement in our revenue generation capacity with non-interest income benefiting from our market leadership in electronic banking channels. “It is also noteworthy to highlight that our investments aimed at improving operational efficiencies and enhancing revenue accretion have resulted in higher cost-to-income ratio. “The benefits of these investments will be realised in subsequent periods. “The new cycle is focused on strengthening and positioning the various businesses across the Group for sustainable growth over the long-term. “As a Group, we are committed to transforming our financial performance to tangible results for the benefit of all stakeholders especially our shareholders through enhanced returns and dividend payment. “As a testament of the resolution of the legacy issues and an indication of the future, FirstBank re-commenced dividend upstream to the holding company,” he stated.
