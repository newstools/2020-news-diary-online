 British Prime
Minister Boris Johnson could return to governing the country as early as Monday
after recovering from the novel coronavirus, according to a media report. The Daily
Telegraph newspaper reported on Friday morning tjat Johnson would be returning
to office in London at a critical stage of the pandemic, as his party members
wish to gradually ease lockdown restrictions. His office had
not confirmed the report. Johnson was
recuperating at Chequers country estate outside London, where he had been
conducting some work duties including taking phone calls from the Queen and
U.S. President Donald Trump, the Press Association news agency reported. Johnson had
been admitted to intensive care in London as his breathing became more
restricted by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. He was released from
hospital on April 12. Foreign
Minister Dominic Raab is currently heading the government, which has come under
criticism for its handling of the pandemic. At least 18,500
people in Britain have died from COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins
university data. (dpa/NAN)
