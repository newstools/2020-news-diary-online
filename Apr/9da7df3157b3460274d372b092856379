 …As PPMC Prepares to Deploy
Automation App for Marketers The Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) has assured Nigerians of availability of sufficient petroleum
products to guarantee hitch-free celebration of Easter. The NNPC Group General Manager,
Group Public Affairs Division, Dr. Kennie Obateru, gave this assurance in a
press release on Wednesday in Abuja. Dr. Obateru quoted the Managing
Director of the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Mr. Musa Lawan, as
saying that although there are restriction of movement orders in parts of the
country, PPMC has maintained steady supply of petroleum products across the
country, adding that the Company has enough products in its marine and land
depots that could last another two months. “I want to assure Nigerians that the
PPMC has enough petroleum products to go round as they prepare to celebrate
Easter. We have up to 2.53billion litres both in marine and in our inland
depots. There is enough petroleum products in stock, and as we speak, some
vessels laden with petroleum products are en route to the country,” Lawan
informed. He revealed that the PPMC would soon
automate its processes, maintaining that the deployment of the application
would reduce face-to-face interactions with marketers and promote transparency
of all its operations. He commended the Association of
Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum (ADTOP), the Independent Petroleum
Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), National Union of Petroleum and
Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), National
Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), operations staff at the depots
and other stakeholders for ensuring the free flow of petroleum products to
every nook and cranny of the country in spite of the restriction of movement in
some states of the Federation. He also urged Nigerians to avoid
panic buying or stock-piling of petroleum products because of the associated
danger and risks.
