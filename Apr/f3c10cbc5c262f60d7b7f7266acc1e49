 President
Muhammadu Buhari says he  rejoices with
His Highness, Christian Atan Otobotekere, the Amananowei of Tombia, in
Ekpetiama Kingdom, Bayelsa State, as he turns 95 on April 21, 2020. Presidential Spokesman, Femi Adesina, who disclosed this in a
statement  said the President salutes the
monarch for his passion to uplift humanity, preserve the environment, and work
for peace and harmony not just in the Niger Delta area, but across the country. “You are a man of the people, a mediator, peacemaker, farmer,
philanthropist, and someone who has worked passionately for
the development of his community,” President Buhari affirms. “As a man with rich literary background, and having published
nine books with at least 200 poems, the President applauds the fecund mind of
the traditional ruler, saying “he has left his footprints indelibly in the
sands of time.” He wished the Amananowei continued good health and sound
mind, even as he attains the princely age of 95.
