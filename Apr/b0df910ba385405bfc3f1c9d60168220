 The Police Command in Edo on Sunday said the command was on the trail of the
kidnappers who abducted the Edo Commissioner for Science and Technology, Mr
Emmanuel Agbale. The spokesman of the command, Mr Chidi Nwabuzor, stated this while fielding
questions on the abducted commissioner from newsmen  in Benin. He said the Police command had deployed men from various departments,
including anti-kidnapping and other special squads, to the trail of the
kidnappers. “We have deployed men from various departments and we are working to ensure
that he is released unharmed,” stated Nwabuzor. Meanwhile, the son of the abducted commissioner, Oise Agbale, said the
kidnappers had contacted the family for a ransom to secure his release. While not disclosing the amount demanded as ransom to secure his release,
Oise, however, appealed for the unconditional release of his father. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Agbale was kidnapped on Friday
along Benin – Ekpoma Highway, while his police orderly was killed in the
process. (NAN)
