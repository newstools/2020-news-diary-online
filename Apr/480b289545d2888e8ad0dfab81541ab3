 The Corps Marshal, Federal Road
Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi has ordered the immediate shutdown of the
Driving School Standardisation Programme’s portal in order to induce compliance
on the suspension of Driving School Operation in Nigeria and further discourage
generation of driving school certificates for trainee-drivers by proxy. According to Bisi Kazeem, the Corps
Public Education Officer, the directive is part of the Corps’ efforts to
compliment all measures already put in place by both the Federal and State
Governments to contain the rise of COVID-19 in Nigeria and also ascertain that
no driving school is presently undergoing any form of training for
trainee-drivers across the country. Quoting the Corps Marshal, Kazeem
said that the Corps is engaging a holistic approach in its attempt to ensure
that the spread of the pandemic is  completely halted against undue
escalation, that is why it refused to stop at the suspension of the operations
of driving schools nationwide alone, but went further to order the immediate
shutdown of the DSSP portal to induce overall compliance. This and many other
measures are directed at encouraging compliance on the stay at home and social
distance directives of the Federal and State Governments. While reiterating the Corps’ resolve
to play its assigned roles in curtailing the global health issue, the
Spokesperson however noted that the Corps regrets any inconveniences the
suspension of the operations of driving schools and the shutdown of the DSSP
portal could have on intending trainee drivers and the operators alike. Concluding, Oyeyemi urged everyone
affected to remain calm and bear with the prevailing situation as the
contemporary directives issued are targeted at preventing them from contracting
or spreading the virus.
