The Lagos State Government has
asserted that none of its ware houses was vandalized and looted contrary to an
online video that alleges that the State Government’s store at Abule Egba
storing the on-going COVID-19 Emergency Food Response stimulus package was
vandalized. A statement issued Wednesday from the
Ministry of Agriculture explained that the allegation is totally false more
importantly as the State Government didn’t have any store house at Abule Egba. The Statement therefore urged
members of the public to disregard both the video and allegation completely.
