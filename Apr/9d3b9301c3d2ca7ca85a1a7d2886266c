in that 1979-83 era, it was never in doubt that Chief Akinjide served the country
and the government of late President Shehu Shagari with dedication, commitment
and with all his deep legal knowledge and immense skills. “He had a passion
for service and even deeper obsession with matters of the law. Chief Akinjide
will not be forgotten in a hurry for his was a powerful voice not only in
matters of law and jurisprudence but also in national affairs, wherein he made
many important interventions at critical periods. “My condolences
also go to the government and people of Oyo State over the loss of their
outstanding son. May God Almighty grant his soul eternal rest and comfort his
family and all those he left behind.”
